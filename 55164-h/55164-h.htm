  <h2 class='c005'>NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><em>Picaroon—a petty rascal; one who lives by his
wits; an adventurer. The Picaresque Tales, in
Spanish literature of the beginning of the Seventeenth
Century, dealt with the fortunes of beggars,
impostors, thieves, etc., and chronicled the Romance
of Roguery. Such stories were the precursors
of the modern novel. The San Francisco
Night’s Entertainment is an attempt to render similar
subjects with an essentially modern setting.</em></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>A MIRACLE AT COFFEE JOHN’S</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The lad in the sweater yawned with abandon
and glanced up at the clock which
hung on the whitewashed wall between a
lithograph of Admiral Dewey and a sign bearing
the legend: “Doughnuts and Coffee, 5 cents.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I move we proceed,” he said, impatiently.
“There’ll be nobody else here to-night; all the
stew-bums have lined up at the bakeries for free
bread. I say, old man, you pull the trigger and
we’re off! I’ve got a two-days’ handicap on my
appetite and I won’t do a thing but make an Asiatic
ostrich of myself!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll back my stomach against yours,” said the
man with spectacles who sat opposite him. “I’ll
bet I could eat a ton of sinkers and a barrel of this
brown paint. I’m for rounding up the grub myself.
I’ll be eating the oil-cloth off this table, pretty
soon!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The proprietor of the dingy little restaurant
turned to them from the counter in front, where he
had been arranging a pile of wet plates and an exhibit
of pastry in preparation for the next morning’s
breakfasts. Wiping his hands on his apron, he
said with a Cockney accent which proclaimed his
birth, hinted at by his florid countenance and mutton-chop
whiskers, “I sye, gents, if yer don’t want
to wyte, yer know bloomin’ well wot yer <em>kin</em> do,
an’ that’s git art! Strike me pink if yer ain’t gort
a gall! Yer a bit comin’ on, gents, if yer don’t
mind me syin’ it. I told yer I’d give yer an A1
feed if yer’d on’y wyte for another bloke to show
up, an’ he ain’t ’ere yet, is ’e? Leastwise, if ’e is,
I don’t see ’im.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took off his apron, nevertheless, as if he, too,
were anxiously expectant, and he cast repeated
glances at the door, where, painted on the window
in white letters, were the words, “Coffee
John’s.” Then he left the range behind the counter
and came across the sanded floor to the single oil-lamp
that lighted the two men who were his last
patrons for the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The younger, he with the red sweater, had a
round, jocund face and a merry, rolling eye that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>misfortune was powerless to tame, though the lad
had evidently discovered Vagabondia.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who’s your interesting but mysterious friend?”
he asked. “You’re not expecting a lady, I hope!”
and he glanced at his coat which, though it had
the cut of a fashionable tailor, was an atrocious
harlequin of spots and holes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know who’s a comin’ no more’n you
do,” Coffee John replied. “But see ’ere!” and
he pointed with a blunt red finger at an insurance
calendar upon the wall. “D’yer cop that there
numero? It’s the Thirteenth of October to-dye,
an’ they’ll be comp’ny all right. They allus is, the
Thirteenth of October!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you rope him and we’ll brand him,” remarked
the other at the table, a man of some
twenty-two years, with a typically Western cast of
countenance, high cheek-bones and an aquiline
nose. His eyes were gray-blue behind rusty steel
spectacles. “I hope that stranger will come pretty
durn pronto,” he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’ll be somethink a-doin’ before nine, I
give yer <em>my</em> word. I’ll eat this ’ere bloomin’ pile
o’ plytes if they ain’t!” Coffee John asserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely had he made the remark when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>clock rang out, ending his sentence like a string of
exclamation points, and immediately the door burst
open and a man sprang into the room as though he
were a runaway from Hell.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his long, thin, white face two black eyes, set
near together, burned with terror. His mouth was
open and quivering, his hands were fiercely clinched.
Under a battered Derby hat his stringy black hair
and ragged beard played over his paper collar in a
fringe. He wore a cutaway suit, green and shiny
with age, which, divorced at the waist, showed a
ring of red flannel undershirt. He crept up to the
counter like a kicked spaniel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For God’s sake, gimme a drink o’ coffee, will
you?” he whined.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wot’s bitin’ yer?” Coffee John inquired without
sentiment. “Don’t yer ask me to chynge a
’undred-dollar bill, fur I reelly can’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I lost my nerves, that’s all,” he said, looking
over his shoulder apprehensively. Then, turning
to the two at the table, he gazed at them over the
top of a thick mug of coffee. “Lord! That’s
good! I’m better now,” he went on, and wiped off
his mustache with a curling tongue, finishing with
his sleeve. “If I should narrate to you the experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>which has just transpired, gents, you wouldn’t
believe it. You’d regard myself as a imposition.
But facts is authentic, nevertheless, and cannot be
dissented from, however sceptical.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here!” cried the lad in the sweater, not
too unkindly, “suppose you tell us about it some
other time! We’ve been waiting for you many
mad-some moons, and the time is ripe for the harvest.
If you are as hungry as we are, and want
to be among those present at this function, sit down
and you’ll get whatever is coming to you. You can
ascend the rostrum afterward. We were just looking
for one more, and you’re it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The vagabond looked inquiringly at Coffee John,
who, in response, pointed to a chair. “Why cert’nly,”
the new-comer said, removing his hat, “I
must confess I ain’t yet engaged at dinner this evening,
and if you gents are so obliged as to——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rope it!” roared the man in spectacles, out of
all patience. The voluble stranger seated himself
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffee John now drew two tables together.
“Jest excuse me for half a mo’, gents, w’ile I unfurl
this ’ere rag,” he said, spreading the cloth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three strangers looked on in surprise, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Cockney’s tone had changed. He wore an expectant
smile as he seated himself in the fourth
place and rapped loudly on the table, distributing,
as he did so, a damask napkin to each of his guests.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gloriana peacock!” cried the man in spectacles,
“I’m sorry I forgot to wear my dress-suit. I
had no idea you put on so much dog for coffee and
sinkers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get wise, old chap,” the man in the sweater
said, warningly, “I have a hunch that this is to be
no mere charity poke-out. This is the true chloroform.
We’re up against a genuine square this trip, or
I’m a Patagonian. How about that, Coffee John?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The host tucked his napkin into his neck and replied,
benignly, “Oh, I dunno, we’ll do wot we kin,
an’ them as ain’t satisfied can order their kerridges.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke, two Chinamen emerged from the
back room and filed up the dusky rows of tables,
bearing loaded trays. Swiftly and deftly they
spread the board with cut glass, china, and silverware,
aligning a delectable array of bottles in
front of the proprietor. In a trice the table began
to twinkle with the appointments of a veritable
banquet, complete even to a huge centre-piece of
California violets. In that shabby hole an entertainment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>began to blossom like a flower blooming
in a dunghill, and the spectators were awed and
spellbound at the sudden miracle of the transformation.
The man in the red sweater loosened his
belt three holes under the table, the black-eyed
man pulled a pair of frayed cuffs from his sleeves,
and the other wiped his glasses and smiled for the
first time. When all was ready, Coffee John arose,
and, filling the glasses, cried jubilantly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gents, I give yer the good ’elth of Solomon
Bauer, Esquire, an’ the Thirteenth of October, an’
drink ’earty!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The toast was drunk with wonder, for the
men were visibly impressed, but, at the entry of
oysters, each began to eat as if he were afraid it
were all a dream and he might awake before it
was over. The lad with the merry eye alone
showed any restraint; his manners were those of
a gentleman. The one with the spectacles drank
like a thirsty horse, and the thin, black-haired individual
watched the kitchen-door to see what was
coming next. Following the oysters came soup,
savoury with cheese.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Potage <em>au fromage</em>, <em>a la</em> Cafe Martin</span>, or I’ve
never been in New York!” cried the youngster.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Correck. I perceive yer by wye of bein’ an
epicoor,” Coffee John remarked, highly pleased at
the appreciation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t think they could do it in San Francisco,”
the youth went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cockney turned his pop-eyes at the lad,
and, with the bigotry of a proselyte, broached his
favourite topic. “Young man, we kin do anythink
they kin do in New York, not to speak of a trick
or two blokes go to Paris to see done; an’ occysionally
we kin go ’em one better. Yer don’t know
this tarn yet. It’s a bloomin’ prize puzzle, that’s
wot it is; they’s a bit o’ everythink ’ere!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fish followed, barracuda as none but Tortoni
can broil; then terrapin, teal, venison, and so,
with Western prodigality, to the dessert. The
guests, having met and subdued the vanguard of
hunger, did hilarious battle with the dinner, stabbing
and slashing gallantly. No one dared to put
his good fortune to the hazard of the inquiry, though
each was curious, until at last the lad in the sweater
could resist wonder no longer. The demands
of nature satisfied, his mind sought for diversion.
He laid his fork down, and pushed back his
plate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“It’s too good to be true,” he said. “I want to
know what we’re in for, anyway! What’s your
little game? It may be bad manners to be inquisitive,
but I’ve slept in a wagon, washed in a
horse-trough and combed my hair with tenpenny
nails for so long that I’m not responsible. The time
has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things!
and I balk right here until I know what’s up your
sleeve. No bum gets a Delmonico dinner at a coffee-joint
on the Barbary Coast for nothing, I don’t
think; and by John Harvard, I want to be put next
to whether this is charity, insanity, a bet, or are you
trying to fix us for something shady?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What d’you want to stampede the show for?”
interrupted the man in spectacles. “We haven’t
been asked to pay in advance, have we? We’ve
signed no contract! You were keen to begin as a
heifer is for salt, and when we draw a prize you
want to look a gift-horse in the jaw! Get onto
yourself!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gents,” the unctuous voice of the third man
broke in, “they’s champagne a-comin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffee John had been looking from one to the
other in some amusement. “Easy, gents,” he remarked.
“I ain’t offended at this ’ere youngster’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>expreshings, though I don’t sye as wot I mightn’t
be, if ’e wa’n’t a gentleman, as I can see by the wye
’e ’andles ’is knife, an’ the suspicious fack of ’is
neck bein’ clean, if he <em>do</em> wear a Jarsey. Nar, all
I gort to sye is, thet this ’ere feast is on the squyre
an’ no questions arsked. As soon as we gits to the
corffee, I’ll explyne.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I accept your apology,” the lad cried, gayly, and
he rose, bubbling with impudence. “Gentlemen-adventurers,
knights of the empty pocket, comrades of
the order of the flying brake-beam and what-not, I
drink your very good health. Here’s to the jade
whose game we played, not once afraid of losing,
ah! It is passing many wintry days since I fed on
funny-water and burned cologne in my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit noir</span></i>,
but there <em>was</em> a time—! My name, brothers of the
pave, is James Wiswell Coffin 3d. Eight Mayflower
ancestors, double-barrelled in-and-in stock,
Puritans of Plymouth. Wrestling Coffin landed at
Salem in the <em>Blessing of the Bay</em>, 1630, and——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whoa, there!” the man in spectacles cried.
“You ain’t so all-fired numerous! I left a happy
mountain-home myself, but the biographical contest
don’t come till the show is over in the big tent!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cert’nly not, after you vetoed at my remarks,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>said the third. “Let’s testify after the dishes is
emptier and we begin to feel more like a repletion!”</p>

<p class='c000'>In such wise the guests proceeded with badinage
till the fruit appeared. Then, as a plate containing
oranges and bananas was placed on the
table, the young man of the party suddenly arose
with a look of disgust, and turned from the sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here, Coffee John,” he said, pacifically,
“would you mind, as a grand transcontinental
favour, removing those bananas? I’m very much
afraid I’ll have to part with my dinner if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wot’s up?” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing, yet,” said the youth. “But I’ll explain
later. We’ll have to work out all these puzzles
and word-squares together.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The bananas were taken away, while the others
looked on curiously. Then the man with glasses
grew serious, and said, “As long as objections
have been raised, and the whole bunch is a bit
loco, I don’t mind saying I’ve a request to make,
myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Speak up, an’ if they’s anythink wrong, I’ll try
to myke it correck,” said Coffee John. “’Evving
knows it ain’t ’ardly usual for the likes o’ me to tyke
orders from the likes o’ you, but this dinner is gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to please, <em>if</em> possible, an’ I don’t want no complyntes
to be neglected. Wot’s the matter nar?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve been sitting with my back to the wall, as
you may have noticed, but there’s that over my head
that makes me feel pretty sick when I catch myself
thinking,” said the objector. “It’s that picture of
Dewey. He’s all right, and a hero for sure; but
if you don’t mind, would you turn him face to the
wall, so I can look up?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t menshing it,” said Coffee John, rising to
gratify this eccentric request. “Nar wot’s your
private an’ partickler farncy?” he asked, turning to
the thin, dark man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothin’ at all, only proceed with the exercises,
and if you’d be magnanimous enough to allow me
to smoke, they being no females present——”</p>

<p class='c000'>A box of Carolina perfectos was brought in, with
a coffee-urn, cognac, and liqueurs, and the three men,
now calm, genial, and satisfied, gave themselves up
to the comforts of tobacco. Even the youngest allowed
himself to draw up a chair for his feet, and
sighed in content. Coffee John finished the last
drop in his glass, drew out his brier pipe, and lighted
it. Then, producing a folded paper from his
pocket, he raised his finger for silence and said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“If yer wants to know the w’y and the w’erfore
of this ’ere reparst, gents, I am nar ready to give
yer satisfaction o’ sorts. It ain’t me yer obligyted
to, at all; it’s a newspyper Johnnie nymed Sol
Bauer who’s put up for it, him as I arsked yer for
to drink a ’elth to. It’s a proper queer story ’ow ’e
come to myke and bryke in this ’ere very shop o’
mine, an’ if yer stogies is all drawin’ easy, I’ll read
the tyle as ’e wrote it art for me, skippin’ the interduction,
w’ich is personal, ’e bein’ of the belief that
it wos me wot brought ’im luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So ’ere goes, from w’ere ’e come darn to this
plyce of a Hoctober night five years ago.” And
so saying, he opened the paper. The narrative,
deleted of Coffee John’s dialect, was as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE GREAT BAUER SYNDICATE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Ten years I had been a newspaper man, and
had filled almost every position from club
reporter to managing editor, when just a
year ago I found myself outside Coffee John’s restaurant,
friendless, hungry, and without a cent to
my name. Although I had a reputation for knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>journalism from A to Z, I had been discharged
from every paper in the city. The reason was
good enough; I was habitually intemperate, and
therefore habitually unreliable. I did not drink, as
many journalists do, to stimulate my forces, but for
love of the game. It was physically impossible for
me to remain sober for more than two weeks at a
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had, that day, been discharged from the <cite>Tribune</cite>
for cause. The new president of the Southern
Pacific Company was on his way to San Francisco,
and it was necessary for our paper to get ahead of
its contemporaries and obtain the first interview.
I was told to meet the magnate at Los Angeles. I
loitered at a saloon till I was too late for the train,
and then decided I would meet my man down the
line at Fresno. The next train south left while I
was still drinking. I had time, however, to catch
the victim on the other side of the bay, and interview
him on the ferry, but he got in before I roused
myself from my dalliance with the grape. Then,
trusting to sheer bluff, I hurried into the office,
called up two stenographers, dictated a fake interview
containing important news, and rushed the
thing on the press.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The next day the president of the railway repudiated
the whole thing, and I was summarily given
the sack. Nevertheless, it so happened that almost
the whole of what I had predicted came true within
the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>I celebrated the bad luck in my characteristic
manner, and finished with just sense enough to wish
to clear my head with black coffee. So, trusting to
my slight acquaintance with Coffee John, and more
to his well-known generosity, I entered his place, and
for the first time in my life requested what I could
not pay for. I was not disappointed. A cup of
coffee and a plate of doughnuts were handed me
without comment or advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was making my meal in the back part of the
little restaurant, three men, one after the other,
came and sat down at my table. In the general
conversation that ensued I found that one was a
tramp printer, whose boast it was to have worked
and jumped his board-bill in nearly every State in
the Union; one was a book-agent, who had been
attempting to dispose of “The Life of U. S. Grant,”
and the third was an insurance solicitor, who had
failed to make good the trade’s reputation for acumen.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little talk developed the fact that all four of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>were out of funds, and ready for anything that
promised to keep the wolf from the door. Then,
with a journalist’s instinct for putting three and one
together, an idea came to me by which we could
all find a way out of the dilemma.</p>

<p class='c000'>For it so happened that one of the <cite>Herald’s</cite> periodical
upheavals had occurred that very day, and a
general clean-up was being effected in the office.
The city editor, after a stormy interview with his
chief, had resigned, and had carried with him four
of the best men on the staff. Other reporters who
had taken his part had also been let go, and the
city room of the <cite>Herald</cite> was badly in need of assistance.
It was very likely that any man who could
put up any kind of a pretence to knowing the ropes
would stand a fair chance of obtaining a situation
without any trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>My plan was this: Each of the three men was
to apply for a situation as reporter on the <cite>Herald</cite>,
and, if accepted, was to report the next day for his
assignment, and then come immediately to me for
instructions. I was to give them all the necessary
information as to obtaining the material, and, when
they had brought me the facts, write out the story
for them to hand in.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The three men agreed enthusiastically to the venture,
and I spent the evening in coaching them in
the shop-talk and professional terms they would need.
You cannot teach a man what “news” is in one
sitting—a man has to have a nose trained to smell
it, and a special gift for determining its value, but I
described the technical meaning of “a story” and
“covering” a detail. I told them to keep their
eyes open, and gave many examples of how it often
happened that a reporter, when sent out on a little
“single-head” story, would, if he were sharp, get
a hint that could be worked up into a front page
“seven-column scare-head.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, of course, no royal road to journalism,
but there are short-cuts that can be learned. I
gave them points on the idiosyncrasies of the new
man at the city desk, for I knew him well, and I
provided each of them with a yarn about his supposed
previous place. One, I believe, was to have
worked on the St. Louis <cite>Globe-Herald</cite>, under George
Comstock; one had done special writing on the Minneapolis
<cite>Argus</cite>, and so on; for I knew a lot about
all the papers in the East, and I fixed my men so
they couldn’t easily be tripped up on their autobiographies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>They went down to the <cite>Herald</cite> office that night,
and after I had waited an hour or so, I had the
satisfaction of hearing that all three of my pupils
had been accepted. It was agreed that each of
them was to give me half his salary, and so I had a
fair show of earning a man and a half’s wages as
President of the Great Bauer Syndicate.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one o’clock the next afternoon I sat down in
Coffee John’s and waited for my subordinates to
report. As each man came in I gave him minute
instructions as to the best possible way of obtaining
his information. There was not a trick in the trade
I didn’t know, and I had never been beaten by any
paper in town. I had succeeded in obtaining interviews
at two in the morning from persons avowedly
hostile to my sheet, I had got photographs
nobody else could get, and I had made railroad
officials talk after an accident. Without conceit, I
may claim to be a practical psychologist, and where
most men know only one way of getting what they
want, I know four. My men had little excuse for
failing to obtain their stories, and they walked out
of Coffee John’s like automata that I had wound up
for three hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>They returned between four and five o’clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>gave me the information they had secured, and,
while they reported to the city editor, received instructions
as to writing the story, and got their evening’s
assignment, I wrote the articles at railroad
speed. I could tell as well as any city editor how
much space the stories were worth, and wrote the
head-lines accordingly—for in the <cite>Herald</cite> office
every reporter was his own head-line writer.</p>

<p class='c000'>If by any chance the editor’s judgment were not
the same as mine, it took but a few minutes to cut
the thing down or pad it to any length, and my men
took the copy back before they went out on the
next detail. Meanwhile, I had given them their
new directions, and, when they turned up, toward
ten and eleven at night, I had the whole batch of
writing to do again. It was a terrific pace for any
one man to keep up, and I doubt if anyone else in
San Francisco could have kept three busy and
turned out first-class work.</p>

<p class='c000'>This went on for fifteen days, during which time
I made Coffee John’s joint my headquarters. That
was the only place where I could hope to keep
sober, working at such high pressure, for I didn’t
dare trust myself in a saloon, and I couldn’t afford
to hire an office. The amount of black coffee I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>consumed made me yellow for a year. Whether
Coffee John wondered what I was up to or not I
never knew; at any rate he asked no questions and
made no objections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Great Bauer Syndicate went merrily, and
the members, with the exception of the president,
earned their salaries easily enough. If the job was
especially difficult or delicate, I went out and got
the story myself. At the end of the first week we
drew our pay and divided it according to the agreement,
but there were indications that my men thought
they were getting clever enough to handle the work
alone. If it hadn’t been that while I was waiting
for them to come in I managed to write several
columns of “space,” faked and otherwise, that they
could turn in and get paid for without any work at
all, I would have had trouble in holding them down
to their contracts. Except for this, the prospects
were bright for the prettiest little news syndicate
that ever fooled a city editor. We made a record
for two weeks, and then came the crash.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had been as sober as a parson for fifteen long,
weary days, beating my record by twenty-four
hours. I had drenched myself in black coffee, and
turned out copy like a linotype machine, keyed up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to a tension so tight that something had to give
way. You can easily imagine what happened.
One Monday night, after the last batch of copy had
been delivered, and I had drawn down my second
week’s pay, I relapsed into barbarism and cast care
to the winds for the nonce.</p>

<p class='c000'>I started down the line, headed for Pete Dunn’s
saloon at 1 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.M.</span></span>, with thirty dollars in my pocket,
and I found myself on Wednesday morning at the
Cliff House, with an unresponsive female, whom
I was imploring to call me “Sollie.” What had
happened to me in the interim I never cared to investigate.
But the Great Bauer Syndicate was out
of business.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems that my three subordinates showed up
as usual on Tuesday afternoon, and after waiting for
me a while they attempted to cover their assignments
without my help. The insurance solicitor
got all twisted up, and never came back; the printer
threw up his job when he failed to find me on his
return. But the book-agent had grown a bit conceited
by this time, and he thought he was as good
as anybody in the business. So he sat down and
wrote out his story, and by what they say about it,
it must have been something rich enough to frame.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>He had picked up a good many stock newspaper
phrases, like “repaired to the scene of the disaster,”
and “a catastrophe was imminent,” and “the last
sad offices were rendered,” and “a life hung in the
balance,” and such rot, and he had a literary ambition
that would have put the valedictorian of a female
seminary to the blush. He had an idea that my
work was crude and jerky, so he melted down a lot
of ineffable poetical bosh into paragraphs hot enough
to set the columns afire. As for the story, you
couldn’t find it for the adjectives. He may have
been a wonder at selling “The Life of U. S. Grant,”
but he couldn’t write English for publication in a
daily paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he turned the stuff in, the city editor
gave a look at it, put about three swift questions to
him, and the cat was out of the bag. It took no
time at all to sweat the story out of him, and they
sent that book-agent downstairs so quickly that
he never came back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole office went roaring over the way I’d
done the paper, and the first thing I knew I was
sent for, and the managing editor told me that if I’d
take the Keeley cure for four months he’d give me
the Sunday editor’s place and forget the episode.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The time I put in at Los Gatos taking chloride of
gold was the darkness that preceded my financial
dawn. When I graduated I hated the smell of
whiskey so much that I couldn’t eat an ordinary
baker’s mince-pie. Six months after that I was
sent for by the New York <cite>Gazette</cite>, where I am
now drawing a salary that makes my life in San
Francisco seem insipid.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Coffee John folded the document carefully and
restored it to his pocket with consideration. “Thet’s
the wye ’e wrote it darn for me, an’ I’ve read it
every year since. Yer see, gents, Sol. Bauer ’avin’
gort the idea I was, in a wye, the means of his restorashing

propose thet we all drink ’is very good ’ealth again,
after w’ich, them as is agreeable will tell ’is own
story for the mutual pleasure of the assembled company
’ere present.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The three men agreed, and filled their glasses
to the grateful memory of Solomon Bauer of the
Great Bauer Syndicate.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>“Nar, young man,” said Coffee John, pointing
the stem of his pipe at the lad in the
red sweater, “seein’ we’ve all agreed to
testify, s’pose yer perceed to open the ball. You
come in fust, an’ you talk fust. I ain’t no fly cop,
but it strikes me you’re a bit different from the rest
of us, though we’re all different enough, the Lord

to myke yer conspicus in this ’ere shop. I see a

<p class='c000'>“But wot I cawn’t figger art,” he continued, “is

knives, an’ comb their w’iskers with their bloomin’
forks, but this ’ere is a new one on me, an’ it
gets my gyme. I’m nar ready to listen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even so!” said the youth. “Then I shall
now proceed to let the procession of thought
wriggle, the band play, and the bug hop. The
suspense, I know, is something terrible, so I spare
your anxiety.” And with this fanfare he began to
relate</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE HARVARD FRESHMAN</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>When I received a cordial invitation
from the Dean to leave Harvard the
second time—on that occasion it was for
setting off ten alarm-clocks at two-minute intervals
in chapel—the governor flew off the handle. My
fool kid brother, that was to side-track the letter
from the faculty, got mixed on his signals, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>telegram that the old man sent back nearly put the
Cambridge office out of business. He said that I had
foozled my last drive, and, although a good cane is
sometimes made out of a crooked stick, he washed
his hands of me, and would I please take notice
that the remittances were herewith discontinued.</p>

<p class='c000'>I noticed. After I’d settled up and given my
farewell dinner to the Institute, where they were
sorry to lose me because I was playing a cyclone
game on the Freshman Eleven, I had ninety-eight
dollars, and twelve hours to leave the college yard.
Thinking it over, it struck me that the keenest way
for me to get my money’s worth was to go out and
take a sub-graduate course as a hobo—do the
Wyckoff act, minus the worker and the prayer-meetings.
I wasn’t going to beg my meals—there
was where the pride of the Coffins stuck out—but
I was willing to stand for the rest—dust, rust, and
cinders. As a dead-head tourist, ninety-eight bones
would feed me and sleep me for quite a space. I
swung on at South Boston for my first lesson in
brake-beams, and, tumbled off mighty sick at Worcester.</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s a long tale, with hungry intervals, until I
found myself in the pound, at Peru, Illinois, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>smashing a fresh brakeman and running up against
the constabulary. The police judge of that hustling
little Western centre is paid out of the fines that
he collects. It is a strange coincidence that when
I was searched I had forty-seven, twenty, on my
person, and my fine for vagrancy and assault came
to forty dollars, with seven-twenty costs. The
judge was a hard-shell deacon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next week, after I crawled out of the underground
Pullman, at Louisville, I was watching Senator
Burke’s racing stables come in, and I was
hungry enough to digest a sand-car. It being work
or beg, I says, “Here’s where I break the ethics
of my chosen profession and strike for a job.”
There was nothing doing until one of the hands mentioned,
for a joke, that a waiter was wanted for the
dining-room where the nigger jockeys ate. “It is
only a matter of sentiment,” said I to myself, “and
my Massachusetts ancestors fit and bled and died to
make freedmen out of the sons of Ham. Here
goes for a feed.” I took the place, collecting a
breakfast in advance, and threw chow for three
meals at coloured gentlemen who buried it with
their knives. “If I am the prodigal son,” says I to
myself, “these are the swine, all right.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>There was a black exercise-boy in the bunch who
played the prize Berkshire hog. He was rather
big for a man about the stables. Superstition held
that he could lick everything of his weight on earth,
and he acted as though he was a front-page feature
in the <cite>Police Gazette</cite>. During the fourth meal he
got gay over my frank, untrammelled way of passing
soup. By way of repartee, I dropped the tray,
tucked up my apron, and cleared for action.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, I wiped off one end of the table with him,
the way the hired girl handles crumbs. Then I
hauled him out into the light of day, so as not to
muss the dining-room, and stood him up against the
pump, and gave him the Countercheck Quarrelsome.
He was long on life and muscle, but short on science,
and he swung miles wide. After I’d ducked
and countered two attempts, he dropped his head
all of a sudden. I saw what was coming. I got
out of range and let him butt, and when he came into
my zone of fire I gave him the knee good and proper.
His face faded into a gaudy ruin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The superintendent came down to restore order,
and saw how merrily I jousted. He was a bit
strict, but he was a true Peruvian in some ways,
and he loved a scrapper. That night I got a hurry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>call to the office, and walked away James Wiswell
Coffin 3d, anointed assistant rubber. After the
season was over at Louisville, we pulled up stakes
and hiked on to Chicago, following the circuit.
When we moved I was raised to night-watchman—forty
and found. Nothing happened until close to
the end of the season at Chicago, except that I ate
regularly. Money was easy in that part. Whenever
I picked up any of it I looked around for good
things in the betting. Without springing myself
any, I cleaned up a little now and then, and when
the big chance came I was $200 to the good.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the way that Fate laid herself open, so
that I could get in one short-armed jab ere she
countered hard. It was the night before a big
race, really more important to us than the Derby.
Everyone around the stables was bughouse with it.
Before I went out on watch, the superintendent—his
name was Tatum, please remember that—lined
me up and told me that he’d have me garrotted,
electrocuted, and crucified if there was a hair so
much as crossed on either of our entries. We had
two of them, Maduro and Maltese. The pair sold
at six to five. Outside and in, it looked as though
the old man hadn’t had a cup nailed so hard for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>years. The trainers were sleeping beside the ponies,
but I was supposed to look in every half hour to
see how things were coming on. At midnight
Tatum came round and repeated his remarks,
which riled me a bit, and Maduro’s trainer said
he would turn in for a little sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next call, for Heaven knows what nutty reason,
I got back to Maduro’s stall a quarter ahead
of the hour. There was about a teaspoonful of
light coming through the cracks. I got an eye to a
knot-hole, and saw things happening. There was
Maduro trussed like a rib-roast, and trying to jump,
and there was the trainer—“Honest Bob” they
used to call him—poking a lead-pencil up her nose.
He said a swear word and began to feel around in
the mare’s nostril, and pulled out a sponge. He
squeezed it up tight and stuffed it back, and began
to poke again. That was the cue for my grand
entry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning,” I said through the hole;
“you’re sleeping bully.” I was cutting and sarcastic,
because I knew what was up. The sponge-game—stuff
it up a horse’s nose, and he can walk
and get around the same as ever, but when he tries
to run, he’s a grampus.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>He was too paralysed even to chuck the pencil.
He stood there with his hands down and his mouth
open.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, hello,” he said, when his wind blew back.
“I was just doctoring the mare to make her sleep.”
All this time I’d been opening the latch of the door,
and I slid into the corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, sure,” said I, displaying my gun so that it
would be conspicuous, but not obtrusive. “I suppose
you’d like to have me send for Mr. Tatum.
He’d like to hold her little hoof and bend above
her dreams,” says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, there’s no necessity for bothering him,”
said “Honest Bob,” in a kind of conciliatory way,
and edging nearer to me all the time. I might
have been caught if I hadn’t noticed that his right
hand was lifted just a bit with the two first fingers
spread. I learned that game with the alphabet.
You slide in on your man, telling him all the time
that he is your lootsy-toots, until you get your right
in close, and then you shoot that fork into both his
lamps. He can neither see nor shoot nor hit until
his eyes clear out, which gives you time to do him
properly. “Honest Bob” was taking a long
chance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>I guarded my eyes and shoved the gun in his
face. I felt like Old Nick Carter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much do you want?” said he, all of a
sudden.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The honour of the Coffins never stoops to
bribery,” said I; “but if you’ll tell me what’s going
to win to-morrow, I’ll talk business. If the tip’s
straight, I forget all about this job.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Early Rose,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The devil you say!” said I. Early Rose was
selling at twenty-five to one. I gave it to him
oblique and perpendicular that if his tip was
crooked I would peach and put him out of business
for life. He swore that he was in the know.
For the rest of that night I omitted Maduro’s stall
and did some long-distance thinking.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could see only one way out of it. Maduro
loses sure, thinks I, and whether it’s to be Early
Rose or not, there’s an investigation coming that involves
little Jimmy 3d. What’s the matter with
winning a pot of money and then disappearing in a
self-sacrificing spirit, so that “Honest Bob” can
lay it all to me? I was sick of the job, anyway.</p>

<p class='c000'>What happened next day has passed into the
history of the turf, but the thing that wasn’t put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>into the papers was the fact that I was in on Early
Rose with one hundred and ninety plunks at
twenty-five to one. He staggered home at the
head of a groggy bunch that wilted at the three-quarters.
I sloped for the ring and drew down
$4,940. Just what happened, and whether the
nags were all doped or not, I don’t know to this
day, but there must be more in this horse-racing
business than doth appear to the casual débutante.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two minutes after I left the bookies I was
headed for the overland train. Just as we pulled
out, I looked back, proud like a lion, for a last gloat
at Chicago. There, on the platform, was that man
Tatum, with a gang from the stables, acting as
though he were looking for someone. In the front
of the mob, shaking his fist and doing the virtuous in
a manner that shocked and wounded, was “Honest
Bob.” I took the tip, dropped off two stations
down the line, doubled back on a local to a child’s
size Illinois town, and rusticated there three days.</p>

<p class='c000'>I’d had time to think, and this was the way it
looked: Where the broad Pacific blends with the
land of freedom and railway <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prospecti</span>, the Mistress
of the Pacific dreams among her hills. Beneath
her shades lie two universities with building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>plans and endowments. It occurred to me that I’d
better make two packages of my money. One of
nine hundred was to get me out to San Francisco
and show me the town in a manner befitting my
birth and station. The other was to transport me
like a dream through one of the aforesaid universities
on a thousand a year, showing the co-eds what
football was like. With my diplomas and press
notices tucked under my arm, I would then report
at the residence of James Wiswell Coffin 2d, at
South Framingham, and receive a father’s blessing.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time I’d landed at this Midway Plaisance
and bought a few rags, the small package
looked something like four hundred dollars. It was
at this stage of the game that I met the woman
starring as the villainess in this weird tale. We
went out to the Emeryville track together. All of
my four hundred that I didn’t pay for incidentals
I lost the first day out.</p>

<p class='c000'>But that makes no never mind, says I to myself;
it’s easy to go through a California university on
seven-fifty per, and besides, a college course ought
to be three years instead of four. So I dipped into
the big pile. Let us drop the quick curtain. When
it rises I am centre stage in the Palace Hotel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>ninety-dollar overcoats and pin-checked cutaways
to right and left, katzenjammer R. U. E., a week’s
board-bill hovering in the flies above me—and
strapped. I gets up, puts my dress-suit into its
case, tucks in a sweater and a bunch of ties, tells
the clerk that I am going away for a day or so, and
will leave my baggage until I can come back and
settle, and walks into the cold, wet world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dress-suit brought eight dollars. That fed
me and slept me in a little room on Third Street for
a week. After dragging the ties through every
pawn-shop from Tar Flat to the Iron Works, I got
a dollar for them. They cost twenty. Next was
the suit-case—two and a half. The third day
after that I had dropped the last cent, and was
leaving my lodgings two jumps ahead of the landlord,
a great coarse Swede.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hadn’t a thing but the clothes on my back. In
a vacant basement of a house on Folsom Street
I found a front step invisible to the naked eye of the
cop on the beat. There I took lodgings. I got
two meals by trading my trousers for a cheaper
pair and twenty cents to boot from the Yiddish
man in the shop above. When that was gone I
roamed this grand old city for four days and three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>nights, and never did such a vulgar thing as eat.
That’s no Child’s Dream of a Star.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth day was a study in starvation.
Dead serious, joshing aside, that was about as
happy a time as I ever put in. I forgot that I was
hungry, and up against the real thing. I saw myself
like some other guy that I had a line on, chasing
about ’Frisco in that fix. I myself was warm
and comfortable, and having a dreamy sort of a
time wandering about.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was strolling down Kearney Street, listening to
the birds singing through the haze, when something
that wore scrambled whiskers and an ash-barrel
hat advised me to go down to Broadway wharf
and take a chance with the fruit bums. He steered
me the proper course, and I smoked the pipe along
Broadway. There was the wharf all right, and
there was a whole cargo of bananas being lifted on
a derrick and let down. Once in a while one
would drop. The crowd underneath would make
a jump and fight for it. I stood there wondering
if I really wanted any bananas, or if it was worth
while to eat, seeing that I’d have to do it again, and
was now pretty well broken of the habit, when a
big, scaly bunch got loose from the stem and began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to shake and shiver. I got under it and made a fair
catch, and went through the centre with it the
way I used to go through the Yale Freshmen line.
There were seventeen bananas, and I ate them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next thing, I began to feel thirsty. So I
marched up to that Coggswell joke on Ben Franklin,
somewhere in the dance-hall district, and
foundered myself with water. After that I crawled
into a packing-box back of a wood-yard, and for
two days I was as sick as Ham, Shem, and Japhet
the second day out on the Ark.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got better I was hungry again. It was
bananas or nothing. I found them carting off the
cargo, and managed to pick up quite a load in one
way or another. After dark I took up two piles
and salted them down back of my packing-box.
Next day, pretty weak yet, I stayed at home and
ate bananas. When the new moon shone like a
ripe banana-peel in the heavens of the next night, I
never wanted to see a banana as long as I lived.
Nathless, me lieges, they were all that I had. After
breakfast next morning, I shook my clothes out, hid
the sweater, and put on my collar to go downtown.
On the way I couldn’t look at the bananas
on the fruit-stands. At the end of the line I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>bumped into a big yellow building with arches on
its front and a sign out:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Football players please see Secretary.” I
looked and saw that it was the Y. M. C. A.
“Aha,” says I, “maybe I dine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I sang a good spiel to the Secretary. They were
getting up a light-weight team and wanted talent.
Thanking the gods that I was an end instead of a
centre, I spun him some dream about the Harlem
Y. M. C. A. He said report that afternoon. I
went back, choked down ten bananas for strength,
and got out on the field in a borrowed suit. They
lined up for only five minutes, but that was time
enough for me to show what I could do.</p>

<p class='c000'>I waited after the game to hear someone say
training-table, and no one peeped. I stood around,
making myself agreeable, and they said come around
to the Wednesday socials, but no one asked me
to say grace at his humble board. By the time I
had washed up and got back home to the packing-box,
I was the owner of such a fifty-horse-power
hunger that I simply <em>had</em> to eat more bananas. I
swore then and there that it was my finish. Why,
the taste of them was so strong that my tongue felt
like a banana-peel!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>After dinner I piked back to the Y. M. C. A.,
seeing that it was my only opening, and began to
study the <cite>Christian Advocate</cite> in the reading-room.
And the first thing that I saw was a tailor-made
that looked as though it had been ironed on her,
and a pair of coffee-coloured eyes as big as doughnuts.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I rubbered at her over the paper I saw her
try to open one of the cases where they kept the
silver cups. That was my cue. It wasn’t two
minutes before I was showing her around like a
director. I taught her some new facts about the
Y. M. C. A., all right, all right. She was a <cite>Tribune</cite>
woman doing a write-up, and she caught my
game proper. We’d got to the gym, and I was
giving the place all the world’s indoor athletic records,
when she turned those lamps on me and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t belong here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t?” says I. “Don’t I strike you for as
good a little Y. M. C. A.’ser as there is in the
business?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked me over as though she were wondering
if I was somebody’s darling, and said in a serious
way:</p>

<p class='c000'>“My mother and I have supper at home. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>brother’s just come on from the East, and I’d like
to have you meet him. Could you join us this
evening?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Realising the transparency of that excuse for a
lady-like poke-out, I tried to get haughty and plead
a previous engagement, but the taste of bananas rose
up in my mouth and made me half-witted. When
we parted she had me dated and doddering over
the prospects. Then I raised my hand to my chin
and felt the stubble. “A shave is next in order,”
says I. So I stood at the door and scanned the
horizon. Along comes the football captain. If he
was in the habit of shaving himself, I gambled that
I would dine with a clean face. I made myself as
pleasant as possible. Pretty soon he began to
shift feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Going down the street?” said I. “Well, I’ll
walk along.” We got to his lodgings. “Going in?”
said I. “Well, I’d like to see your quarters,” and
I walked in. “Pretty rooms. That’s a nice safety
razor you have there. How do you strop it?”
He showed me, kind of wondering, and I said,
“How’s your shaving-soap?” He brought it.
“Looks good,” said I, heading for the washstand.
I jerked in a jet of cold water, mixed it up, lathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>my face, and began to shave, handing out chin-music
all the time about Social Settlement work.
He said never a word. It was a case of complete
paralysis. When I had finished I begged to be excused.
He hadn’t even the strength to see me to
the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oh, the joy of walking to Jones Street, realising
with every step that I was going to have something
to take the taste of bananas out of my mouth! I
got to playing wish with myself. I had just decided
on a tenderloin rare-to-medium, and Bass ale, when
I bumped on her house and the cordial welcome.
It was one of those little box flats where the dining-room
opens by a folding-door off the living-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you wait here just a minute?” said the
girl with the doughnut orbs, “I want you to meet
my brother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was gone longer than I expected. She was
a thoroughbred to leave such a hobo as me alone
with the silver. It got so that I just had to look at
the scene of the festivities. It was here, all right,
a genuine Flemish quarter-sawed oak dining-table,
all set, and me going to have my first square meal
for ten days. About that time I heard two voices
in the back of the house. One was the girl’s; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>other was a baritone that sounded mighty familiar.
I explored farther, and the next clew was a photograph
on the mantel that lifted my hair out of its
socket.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was signed “Your loving brother, John,” and
it was the picture of John Tatum, the manager of
Burke’s stables!</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw my dinner dwindling in the distance. I
saw myself breakfasting on bananas, and says I,
“Not on your hard luck.” I wouldn’t swipe the
silver, but, by all the gods of hunger, if there was a
scrap to eat in that dining-room I was going to have
it. I ran through the sideboard; nothing but salt,
pepper, vinegar, and mustard. China closet; nothing
but dishes. There was only one more place in
the whole room where grub could be kept. That
was a sort of ticket-window arrangement in the far
corner. Footsteps coming; “Last chance,” says I,
and breaks for it like a shot. I grabbed the handle
and tore it open.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there was a large, fine plate of rich, golden,
mealy bananas!</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE EX-MEDIUM</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I am Professor Vango, trance, test, business,
materialisin’, sympathetic, harmonic, inspirational,
and developin’ medium, and independent
slate-writer. Before I withdrew from the
profession, them as I had comforted and reunited
said that I was by far the best in existence. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>tests was of the sort that gives satisfaction and convinces
even the most sceptical. My front parlor was
thronged every Sunday and Tuesday evenin’ with
ladies, the most genteel and elegant, and gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I really learned my powers, I was a palm
and card reader. Madame August, the psychic
card-reader and Reno Seeress, give me the advice
that put me in communication. She done it after
a joint readin’ we give for the benefit of the Astral
Seers’ Protective Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Vango,” she says—I was usin’ the name
“Vango” already; it struck me as real tasty—“Vango,”
she says, “you’re wastin’ your talents.
These is the days when men speak by inspiration.
You got genius; but you ain’t no palmist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why ain’t I?” I says, knowin’ all the time that
they was somethin’ wrong; “don’t I talk as good as
any?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re a genius,” says she, “and you lead
where others follow; your idea of tellin’ every
woman that she can write stories if she tries is one
of the best ever conceived, but if you don’t mind
me sayin’ it, as one professional to another, it’s your
face that’s wrong.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My face?” says I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Your face and your hands and your shape and
the balance of your physicality,” says she. “They
want big eyes—brown is best, but blue will do—and
lots of looks and easy love-makin’ ways that
you can hang a past to, and I’m frank to say that
you ain’t got ’em. You <em>have</em> got platform talents,
and you’ll be a phenomena where you can’t get
near enough to ’em to hold hands. Test seances
is the future of this business. Take a few developin’
sittin’s and you’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For the time, disappointment and chagrin overcome
me. Often and often since, I have said that
sorrow is a means of development for a party.
That’s where I learnt it. Next year I was holdin’
test seances in my own room and makin’ spirit photographs
with my pardner for ample renumeration.
Of course, I made my mistakes, but I can assert without
fear of successful contradiction that I brought
true communication as often as any of ’em.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once I sized up a woman that wore black before
I had asked the usual questions—which is a
risky thing to do, and no medium that values a
reputation will attempt it—and told her about her
husband that had passed out and give a message,
and she led me on and wrote me up for them very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>papers that I was advertisin’ in and almost ruined
my prospecks. You get such scoffers all the time,
only later on you learn to look out and give ’em rebukes
from the spirits. It ain’t no use tryin’ to get
ahead of us, as I used to tell the people at my
seances that thought I was a collusion, because
they’ve only got theirselves; but we’ve got ourselves
and the spirits besides.</p>

<p class='c000'>It wasn’t long in the course of eventualities before
I was ordained by the Spirit Psychic Truth
Society, and elected secretary of the union, and gettin’
my percentages from test and trance meetin’s at
Pythian Hall. I was popular with the professionals,
which pays, because mediums as a class is a little
nervous, and—not to speak slanderous of a profession
that contains some of the most gifted scientists—a
set of knockers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only I wasn’t satisfied. I was ambitious in
them days, and I wanted to make my debut in
materialisin’, which takes a hall of your own and a
apparatus and a special circle for the front row,
but pays heavy on the investment. Try every way
I could, with developin’ circles and private readin’s
and palms extra, I could never amass the funds for
one first-class spirit and a cabinet, which ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>be enough to start on. Then one night—it was a
grand psychic reunion and reception to our visitin’
brothers from Portland—<em>She</em> come to the circle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our publication—I united with my other functionaries
that of assistant editor of <cite>Unseen Hands</cite>—stigmatised
it afterward as the grandest demonstration
of hidden forces ever seen on this hemisphere.
It was the climax to my career. I was communicatin’
beautiful, and fortune favoured my endeavours.
When I pumped ’em, they let me see
that which they had concealed, and when I guessed
I guessed with amazin’ accuracy. I told a Swede
all about his sweetheart on the other plane, and the
colour of her hair, and how happy she was, and
how it was comin’ out all right, and hazarded that
her name was Tina, and guessed right the first
trial. I recollect I was tellin’ him he was a physie,
and didn’t he sometimes feel a influence he couldn’t
account for, and hadn’t he ever tried to establish
communication with them on the spirit plane, and
all he needed was a few developin’ sittin’s—doin’
it neat an’ professional, you know, and all of the
other mediums on the platform acquiescin’—when
a woman spoke up from the back of the room.
That was the first time that ever I seen her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>She was a middle-sized, fairish sort of a woman,
in mournin’, which I hadn’t comprehended, or I’d
’a’ found the article that she sent up for me to test
her influence, long before. As soon as she spoke,
I knew she’d come to be comforted. She was a
tidy sort of a woman, and her eyes was dark, sort
of between a brown and a black. Her shape was
nice and neat, and she had a straightish sort of a
nose, with a curve into it. She was dead easy. I
seen that she had rings on her fingers and was
dressed real tasty, and right there it come to me,
just like my control sent it, that a way was openin’
for me to get my cabinet and a stock of spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you please read my article?” she says.
Bein’ against the æsthetics of the profession to
let a party guide you like that, Mrs. Schreiber,
the Egyptian astral medium, was for rebukin’
her. I superposed, because I seen my cabinet
growin’.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was strongly drawed to the token in question,”
I says, and then Mrs. Schreiber, who was there to
watch who sent up what, motioned me to a locket
on the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I come into the room, I seen this party
with a sweet influence hoverin’ over her. Ain’t it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>a little child?” Because by that time I had her
sized up.</p>

<p class='c000'>I seen her eyes jump the way they always do
when you’re guided right, and I knowed I’d touched
the achin’ spot. While I was tellin’ her about my
control and the beautiful light that was hoverin’
over her, I palmed and opened the locket. I got
the picture out—they’re all alike, them lockets—and
behind it was a curl of gold hair and the name
“Lillian.” I got the locket back on the table, and
the spirits guided me to it for her test. When I
told her that the spirit callin’ for her was happy in
that brighter sphere and sent her a kiss, and had
golden hair, and was called “Lillian” in the flesh
plane, she was more overcame than I ever seen a
party at a seance. I told her she was a medium.
I could tell it by the beautiful dreams she had sometimes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Right here, Mrs. Schreiber shook her head, indicatin’
that I was travellin’ in a dangerous direction.
Developin’ sittin’s is saved for parties when you
can’t approach ’em on the departed dear ones. In
cases like the one under consideration, the most
logical course, you comprehend, is to give private
test sittin’s. But I knowed what I was doin’. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>told her I could feel a marvellous power radiate
from her, and her beautiful dreams was convincin’
proof. She expressed a partiality to be developed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got her alone in the sittin’, holdin’ her
hand and gettin’ her to concentrate on my eyes, she
made manifest her inmost thoughts. She was a
widow runnin’ a lodgin’-house. Makin’ a inference
from her remarks, I seen that she hadn’t no money
laid by, but only what she earned from her boarders.
The instalment plan was better than nothin’.
She seized on the idea that I could bring Lillian
back if I had proper conditions to work with. In
four busy weeks, I was enabled by her magnanimity
to open a materialisin’ circle of my own, with a
cabinet and a self-playin’ guitar and four good
spirit forms. I procured the cabinet second-hand,
which was better, because the joints worked easier,
and I sent for the spirits all the way to a Chicago
dealer to get the best. They had luminous forms
and non-duplicated faces, that convinced even the
most sceptical. The firm very liberally throwed
in a slate trick for dark cabinets and the Fox Sisters’
rappin’ table.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took one of them luminous forms, the littlest one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and fixed it with golden curls painted phosphorescent.
Mrs. Schreiber and the rest, all glad to be
partakers in my good fortune, was hired to come
on the front seats and join hands with each other
across the aisle whenever one of the spirits materialised
too far forward toward the audience. We
advertised heavy, and the followin’ Sunday evenin’
had the gratification to greet a numerous and
cultured assemblage. I was proud and happy,
because steppin’ from plain test control to materialisin’
is a great rise for any medium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Higgins—that was her name, Mrs. Clarissa
Higgins—come early all alone. I might ’a’ brought
Lillian right away, only that would be inelegant.
First we sang, “Show Your Faces,” to get the proper
psychie current of mutuality. Etherealisin’ and a
few tunes on a floatin’ guitar was next. When my
control reassured itself, I knowed that the time had
came, and let out the first spirit. A member of
the Spirit Truth Society on the front seat recognised
it for a dear one, and carried on real realistic
and natural. I let it vanish. The next one was
Little Hookah, the spirit of the Egyptian dancer,
that used to regale the Pharaohs in the depths of
the Ghizeh pyramid. I touched off a music-box
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to accompany her for a skirt-dance with her robes.
I done that all myself; it was a little invention of
my own, and was recognised with universal approbation.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was the time for Lillian to manifest herself,
and I done it artistic. First she rapped and
conversed with me in the spirit whisper back of
the curtains. You could hear Mrs. Higgins in the
audience drawin’ in her breath sort of awesome.</p>

<p class='c000'>I says for the spirit, in a little pipin’ voice, “Tell
mamma not to mourn, because her lamentations
hinders my materialisation. The birds is singin’,
and it is, oh, so beautiful on this shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then commandin’ the believers on the front seats
to join hands in a circle of mutuality, in order to
assist the sister on the other shore to put on the
astral symbols of the flesh, I materialised her nice
and easy and gradual.</p>

<p class='c000'>We was prepared for demonstrations on the part
of Mrs. Higgins, so when she advanced I began to
let it vanish, and the psychie circle of clasped hands
stopped her while I done the job up good and complete.
She lost conscientiousness on the shoulder
of Mrs. Schreiber.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not borin’ you, gentlemen, with the details of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>my career, my business and religious relations with
Mrs. Higgins was the beginnin’ of my success.
Myself and the little circle of believers—that
guarded the front seats from the protrusions of
sceptical parties that come to scoff, and not infrequent
come up as earnest inquirers after my control
had passed—we lived easy on the proceeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Higgins would bring tears to your eyes, she
was that grateful. She repaired the place for me
so it was the envy of the unsuccessful in the profession.
She had it fixed with stucco like a grotto,
and wax calla lilies and mottoes and beautiful spirit
paintin’s (Mrs. Schreiber done them out of the air
while she was under control—a hundred dollars
apiece she charged), and nice curtains over the
cabinet, embroidered in snakes’ eyes inside of triangles
and discobuluses. Mrs. Higgins capitalised
the expense. Whenever we done poor business,
we originated some new manifestations for Mrs.
Higgins. She received ample renumeration. She
seen Lillian every Tuesday and Sunday. Very
semi-occasionally, when the planetary conditions
favoured complete manifestation, I used to let her
hug Lillian and talk to her. That was a tremendous
strain, involvin’ the use of ice to produce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>proper degree of grave cold, and my blood nearly
conglomerated whenever circumstances rendered it
advisable.</p>

<p class='c000'>All human relationships draws to a close in time.
After seven years of the most ideal communications
between myself and Mrs. Higgins and the
rest of the Psychic Truth Society, they came a
time one evenin’ when I seen she was missin’. Next
day, we received a message that she was undisposed.
We sent Madam La Farge, the medical
clairvoyant, to give her treatment, and word come
back that them designin’ relatives, that always haunt
the last hours of the passin’ spirit with mercenary
entreaties, had complete domination over her person.
I visited to console her myself, and was rebuked
with insinuations that was a insult to my
callin’. The next day we learned that she had
passed out. We was not even admitted to participate
in the funeral obsequies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Sunday that she was in the spirit Mrs.
Schreiber was all for materialisin’ her. I favoured
omittin’ her, thinkin’ it would be more fittin’, you
understand, and more genteel. But we had some
very wealthy sceptics in the circle we was tryin’ to
convince, and Mrs. Schreiber said they’d expect it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Against my better counsels, seein’ that Mrs. Higgins
was a mighty fine woman and give me my
start, and I got a partiality for her, I took down my
best spirit form and broadened it some, because
Mrs. Higgins had got fleshy before she passed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>After Little Hookah done her regular dance
that Sunday night, I got the hymn started, and
announcin’ that the spirit that rapped was a dear
one known to ’em all, I pulled out the new form
that I had just fixed, and waited for the tap on the
cabinet to show that all was ready. I didn’t like to
do it. I felt funny, like something would go wrong.
But I pulled the string, and then—O God!—there—in
the other corner of the cabinet—was Mrs.
Higgins—Mrs. Higgins holdin’ her arm across the
curtains and just lookin’ at me like her eyes was
tearin’ through me!</p>

<p class='c000'>They seen somethin’ was wrong, and Mrs.
Schreiber got the robe away before they found me—they
said my control was too strong—and some
said I was drunk. I did get drunk, too, crazy
drunk, next day—and when I come round Mrs.
Schreiber tried to do cabinet work with me on the
front seat—and there I seen <em>her</em>—in her corner—just
like she used to sit—and I never went back.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>But a man has got to eat, and when my money
was gone, and I wasn’t so scared as I was at first,
I tried to do test seances, sayin’ to myself maybe she
wouldn’t mind that—and the first article I took up,
there she was in the second row, holdin’—oh,
I couldn’t get away of it—holdin’ a locket just like
she done the first night I seen her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I knew I’d have to quit, and I hid from the
circle—they wanted me because Mrs. Schreiber
couldn’t make it go. I slept in the Salvation
Army shelter, so as not to be alone, and she let me
be for a while.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to-day I seen a party in the street that I
used to give tests to, and he said he’d give me two
bits to tell him about his mine—and I was so broke
and hungry, I give it a trial and—there <em>She</em> was—in
the shadow by the bootblack awnin’—just
lookin’ and lookin’!</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>“I expeck yer cut off yer own nose, all right,”
said Coffee John. “If the sperits of the dead
do return, an’ I was to come along with ’em, it
seems to me I’d plye Mrs. ’Iggin’s gyme, an’ run
abart a million o’ shyster ghost-raisers art o’ business
in this city. I see their notices in the dyly
pypers, an’ it feerly mykes a man sick. The more
you show ’em up, the more the people come to be
gulled. ’Uman nychur is certingly rum. Lord
love yer, I’ve been to ’em, an’ I’ve been told my
nyme was Peter, wa’nt it? an’ if not Peter, Hennery;

with improper lengwidge!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>He turned to the third man, who had made no
comments on the stories. “You’re one as ’as loved
an’ lost,” he said. “Yer look like one as is a lion
with men an’ a bloomin’ mouse with women. You
don’t cyre w’ether school keeps or not, you don’t,

<p class='c000'>The man with glasses had not winced at the
plain language, nor apologised as the medium had
done. He looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, pardner, if you’ll stand for it, I’ll tell
you the truth, right out.” And with this he began</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE HERO OF PAGO BRIDGE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>My name is Admeh Drake. Mine ain’t a
story-book yarn like yours, pardner, or a
tale of spooks and phantoms, like yours.
You can get away from ghosts when there’s other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>people around or it’s daylight, but there’s some
things that you can’t get away from in a thousand
years, daylight or dark.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fellow that I knew from the PL outfit loaned
me a story-book once by “The Duchess,” that said
something like this, only in story-book language:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A woman is the start and finish of all our
troubles.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I always remembered that. It was a right nice
idea. Many and many’s the time that, thinking
over my troubles and what brought me to this elegant
feed—say, I could drink a washtub full of that
new-fangled coffee—I’ve remembered those sentiments.
Susie Latham, that is the finest lady in the
White River country, she was the start and finish
of my troubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ever since we were both old enough to chew
hay, Susie and I travelled as a team. The first
time that ever I shone in society, I did it with
Susie by my side. It was right good of her to go
with me, seeing that I was only bound-boy to old
man Mullins, who brought me up and educated me,
and Susie’s father kept a store. But then we were
too little to care about such things, me being eleven
and Susie nine. It was the mum social of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>First Baptist Church that I took her to. You
know the sort? When the boss Sunday-school
man gives the signal, you clap the stopper on your
jaw-tackle and get fined a cent a word if you peep.
Susie knew well enough that I had only five cents
left after I got in, so what does she do but go out
and sit on the porch while the talk is turned off, so
that she wouldn’t put me in the hole. When they
passed the grab-bag, I blew in the nickel. I got a
kid brass ring with a red glass front and gave it to
her. I said that it was for us to get married when
we grew up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Admeh Drake, I like your gall,” she
said, but she took it just the same. After that,
Susie was my best girl, and I was her beau. I
licked every fellow that said she wasn’t pretty, and
she stuck out her tongue to every girl that tried to
joke me because I was old Mullins’s bound-boy. We
graduated from Striped Rock Union High-school
together. That was where I spent the happy hours
running wild among the flowers in my boyhood’s
happy home down on the farm. After that, she
went to teaching school, and I struck first principles
and punched cattle down on old Mullins’s XQX
ranch. Says I to myself, I’ll have an interest here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>myself some time, and then married I’ll be to
Susie if she’ll but name the day. I had only six
months before I was to be out of bound to old
Mullins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being a darn-fool kid, I let it go at that, and
wrote to her once in a while and got busy learning
to punch cattle. Lord love you, I didn’t have
much to learn, because I was raised in the saddle.
There were none of them better than me
if I did have a High-School education. My eyes
had gone bad along back while I was in the High-school,
calling for spectacles. When I first rode
in gig-lamps, they used to josh me, but when I got
good with the rope and shot off-hand with the
best and took first prize for busting broncos Fourth
of July at Range City, they called me the “Four-eyed
Cow-puncher,” and I was real proud of it.
I wish it was all the nickname I ever had. “The
Hero of Pago Bridge”—I wish to God——</p>

<p class='c000'>The XQX is seventy miles down the river
from Striped Rock. Seventy miles ain’t such a
distance in Colorado, only I never went back for
pretty near two years and a half. Then, one
Christmas when we were riding fences—keeping
the line up against the snow, and running the cattle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>back if they broke the wires and got across—I got
to thinking of the holiday dances at Striped Rock,
and says I: “Here’s for a Christmas as near home
as I can get, and a sight of Susie.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The boss let me off, and I made it in on Christmas
Eve. The dance was going on down at
Foresters’ Hall. I fixed up and took it in.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there she was—I didn’t know her for the
start she’d got. Her hair—that she used to wear
in two molassesy-coloured braids hanging down her
back, and shining in the sun the way candy shines
when you pull it—was done up all over her head.
She was all pinky and whitey in the face the way
she used to be when she was a little girl. She had
on a sort of pink dress, mighty pretty, with green
wassets down the front and a green dingbat around
the bottom, and long—not the way it was when I
saw her before. She was rushed to the corner with
every geezer in the place piled in front of her. I
broke into the bunch. Everybody seemed to see
me except Susie. She treated me like any other
maverick in the herd. She hadn’t even a dance
left for me. Once, in “Old Dan Tucker,” she
called me out, but she’d called out every other
tarantula in the White River country, so there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>no hope in that. If ever a man didn’t know where
he was at, I was the candidate.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that winter, riding the fence, I thought and
thought. I’d been so dead sure of her that I was
letting her go. Here was the principal of the High-school,
and young Mullins that worked in the
Rancher’s Bank, and Biles that owned stock in the
P L, all after her, like broncos after a marked
steer, and I was only the “Four-eyed Cow-puncher,”
thirty dollars and found. And I got
bluer than the light on the snow. And then says
I to myself, if she ain’t married when spring melts,
by the Lord, I’ll have her.</p>

<p class='c000'>I’m one of those that ain’t forgetting the sixteenth
of February, 1898. Storm over, and me mighty
glad of it. Snow all around, except where the
line of fence-rails peeked through, and the sun just
blinding. I on the bronco breaking through the
crust, feeling mighty good both of us. Down in a
little <em>arroyo</em>, where a creek ran in summer, was the
end of my run. Away off in the snow, I saw
Billy Taylor, my side-partner, waving his hand like
he was excited. I pounded my mule on the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Maine’s blown up,” he yells. “The
Maine’s blown up!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“The what?” says I, not understanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Maine—Havana Harbour—war sure!”
he says. I tumbled off in the snow while he chucked
me down a bunch of Denver papers. There it
was. I went as <em>loco</em> as Billy. Before I got back
to camp, I had it all figured out—what I ought to
do. I got to the foreman before noon and drew
my pay, and left him cussing. Lickety-split, the
cayuse—he was mine—got me to the station. I
figured that the National Guard would be the first
to go, and I figured right. So I telegraphed to old
Captain Fletcher of Company N at Range City:
“Have you got room for me?” And he answered
me, knowing just how I stood on the ranches, “Yes.
Can you raise me twenty men to fill my company?”
He didn’t need to ask for men; there were plenty
of them anxious enough to go, but he did need the
sort of men I’d get him. Snow be darned, I rode
for four days signing up twenty hellaroos that would
leave the Rough Riders standing. Into Range
City I hustled them. There we waited on the
town, doing nothing but live on our back pay and
drill while we waited, nineteen for glory and Spanish
blood, and me for glory and the girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Congress got a move on at last, though we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>thought it never would, and the Colorado National
Guard was accepted, enlisting as a body. When
we were in camp together and the medical inspector
went around thumping chests, the captain gave
him a little song about my eyes. “He can’t see
without his glasses,” says Captain Fletcher, “but
he can shoot all right with them on. And he
raised my extra men, and he’s a soldier.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor says, “Well, I’m getting forgetful in
my age, and maybe I’ll forget the eye-test.” Which
he did as he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that was Dewey and Manila Bay, and the
news that the Colorado Volunteers were going to
be sent to the Philippines, which everybody had
studied about in the geography but nobody remembered,
except that they were full of Spaniards just
dying to be lambasted.</p>

<p class='c000'>We got going at last, muster at Denver, and they
gave us a Sunday off to see our folks. You better
believe I took an early train for Striped Rock—and
Susie. A hundred and five miles it was, and
the trains running so that I had just two hours and
twenty-five minutes in the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Susie wasn’t at home, nor any of the Lathams.
They were all in church at the Baptist meetinghouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>where I gave her the grab-bag ring for kid
fun. I went over there and peeked in the door.
A new sky-pilot was in the pulpit, just turned loose
on his remarks. Sizing him up, I saw that he was
a stem-winding, quarter-hour striking, eight-day
talker that would swell up and bust if he wasn’t allowed
to run down. In the third row, I saw Susie’s
hair. There I’d come a hundred miles and more
to say good-by to her, and only two hours to spare;
and there that preacher was taking my time, the
time that I’d enlisted to fight three years for. It
was against nature, so I signalled to the usher and
told him that Miss Susie Latham was wanted at
home on important business.</p>

<p class='c000'>The usher was one of the people that are born
clumsy. The darn fool, instead of going up and
prodding her shoulder and getting her out sort of
quiet, went up and told the regular exhorter who
was sitting up on the platform; and the regular,
instead of putting him on, told the visiting preacher.
The old geezer was deaf.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How thankful we should be, my brethren, that
this hopeless eternity—” he was saying, when the
regular parson broke out of his high-back chair and
tapped him on the broadcloth and began to whisper.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Hey?” says the stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Susie Latham,” says the regular preacher,
between a whisper and a holler.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What about her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wanted at home,” so that you could hear him
all through the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” says the parson. “Brothers and sisters,
I am requested to announce that Miss Susie Latham
is wanted at home on important business—that
this hopeless eternity is set as a guide to our feet—”
and all the rest of the spiel. And me feeling as
comfortable as a lost heifer in a blizzard—forty
kinds of a fool.</p>

<p class='c000'>She came down the aisle, looking red and white
by turns, with all the people necking her way. Before
I’d got time to explain why I did it, her mother
got nervous, thinking there must be some trouble,
and came trailing out after her. Then her kid sister
couldn’t stand the strain, and followed suit.</p>

<p class='c000'>That family reunion on the porch spoiled all the
chance that I had to see Susie alone, because when
they heard why I came, and how I was going to
be Striped Rock’s hero, they were for giving me a
Red Cross reception then and there. Only two
hours more until train time, and the old lady had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to rush me down to the house for lunch—and me
with the rest of my life to eat in!</p>

<p class='c000'>But I shook her and the kid sister at last, and
got Susie alone. I tried to tell her—and I couldn’t.
I could say that I was going to do my best and
maybe die for my country, and there I stalled and
balked, her looking the other way all pretty and
pink, and giving me not a word either way to bless
myself with. Says I finally:</p>

<p class='c000'>“And if I come back, I suppose that you’ll be
married, Susie?” and she says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I don’t think that I’ll be married when you
come back; I don’t think that I’ll ever marry unless
he’s a man that I can be proud of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she looked at me, her big eyes filling—her
big eyes, coloured like the edge of the mountains
after sunset. I’ve figured it out since that she was
more than half proud of me already—me, in a clean,
blue suit, and the buttons shiny; me, a ten-cent,
camp volunteer. And then the old woman broke
in with a bottle of Eilman’s Embrocation for use
in camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never another chance had I that side of the station.
Of course, she kissed good-by, but that’s
only politeness for soldiers. They all did that. So,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>although it was just like heaven, I knew that it
didn’t mean anything particular from her, because
her mother did it and her sister, and pretty darned
near every other girl in Striped Rock, seeing that
the news about having a real hero in town had
spread.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only, when we pulled away and I was leaning
out of the window blowing kisses, being afraid to
blow at Susie in special because I didn’t like to
give myself away, she ran out of the crowd a ways
and held up her little finger to show me something
over the knuckle, and pulled her hand in quick as
if nothing had happened. It was the play kid-ring
that I gave her out of the grab-bag, to show that I
was going to marry her when I grew up.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was the last sight of Striped Rock that I
got—Susie waving at the station as far as I could
see her. It made you feel queer to ride past the
fences and the bunch-grass and the foot-hills getting
grayey-green with sage-brush, and the mountains
away off, all snowy on top, and know that chances
were you’d never see them again grayey. And I
won’t, I won’t—never again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Muster at Denver, and the train, and away we
went, packed like a herd around salt, and the towns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>just black, like a steer in fly-time, with people coming
out to see us pass, and Red Cross lunches every
time the train had to stop for water; next ’Frisco
and Camp Merritt. The first time that I saw this
town, gray all over like a sage-hill, made out of
crazy bay-window houses with fancy-work down the
front, I knew that something was going skewgee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night before we went up for our final medical
examination by the regular army surgeon, Captain
Fletcher called me into his tent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Drake, how about your eyes?” says he.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hadn’t thought of that, supposing that it could
be fixed the same as it was at Range City. I told
him so, and he said it couldn’t, not with the regular
army surgeons. But says he:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re a good soldier, and I got you to raise
my reserves. They won’t let you in if you can’t
pass the eye-test, glasses or no glasses. If it should
happen that you learned a little formula that tallies
with the eye-card, you wouldn’t let on that I gave
it to you, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m good at forgetting,” I says.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Burn it when you’ve learned it,” he says, and
he gave me a paper with long strings of letter on it.
I learned it backward and forward, and so on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>I could begin in the middle and go both ways. I
lay awake half the night saying it over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naked as I was born, I floated in on the examiners
for my physicals. Lungs, as they make them
in the cow-country; weight, first-class; hearing,
O. K. They whirled me and began to point. Taking
a tight squint—you see better that way—I
ripped through the formula: P&thinsp;V&thinsp;X&thinsp;C&thinsp;L&thinsp;M&thinsp;N&thinsp;H—I
can see it yet. I could just see what line on
the card he was pointing at, and never a darned bit
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>They make that sort of a doctor in hell. He
saw me squint—and he began skipping from letter
to letter all over the card. No use—I guessed and
guessed dead wrong. “Rejected!” just businesslike,
as if it was a little matter like a job on a hay-press.
I went out and sat all naked on my soldier-clothes—my
soldier-clothes that I was never going
to wear any more—and covered up my head. It
was the hardest jolt that I ever got—except one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Fletcher hadn’t any pull; he couldn’t
do anything. Some of the twenty that I rounded
into Range City talked about striking, they were so
mad, but that wouldn’t do any good. I watched
them sworn in next day, shuffling into the armory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in new overall clothes. I stood around camp and
saw them drill. I saw them go down the streets
to the transport—flowers in their gun-barrels,
wreaths on their hats, and the people just whooping.
I sneaked after them onto the transport, and
there I broke out and cussed the regular army and
everything else. Old Fletcher saw it. He wasn’t
sore; he understood. But I wish I had killed him
before I let him do what he did next. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“He can’t be with us, boys, and it ain’t his
fault. But Striped Rock is going to have its hero.
I am going to be correspondent for the Striped
Rock <cite>Leader</cite>. If we have the luck to get into a
fight, he’ll be the hero in my piece in the paper, and
the man that gives away the snap ain’t square with
Company N. Here’s three cheers for Admeh
Drake, the hero of Company N!” he said. When
they pulled out, people were cheering them and
they cheering me. It heartened me up considerably,
or else I couldn’t have stood to see them sliding
past Telegraph Hill into the stream and me not
there with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, I was for writing to Susie and telling her
all about it, but I just couldn’t. I put it off, saying
that I’d go back and tell her all about it myself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>I went to mooning around camp like a ghost. And
then along came a copy of the <cite>Leader</cite> that settled
it. All about the big feed that they gave the regiment
at Honolulu, and how Admeh Drake had
responded for the men of Company N. Captain
Fletcher was getting in his deadly work. It said
that I was justly popular, and my engagement to one
of Striped Rock’s fairest daughters was whispered.
It treated me like I was running for Congress on the
<cite>Leader</cite> ticket. I began to wonder if I saw a way
to Susie.</p>

<p class='c000'>After they got to the Islands, I dragged the
cascos through the surf and rescued a squad of
Company N from drowning. All that was in the
<cite>Leader</cite>. The night they scrapped in front of the
town, I stood and cheered on a detachment when
they faltered before the foe. After they got to
Manila and did nothing but lay around, Captain
Fletcher had me rescue a man from a fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that, I began to get next to myself, knowing
that I’d have done best to stop it at the start
and go straight back to Striped Rock. I’d been
a darned fool to put it off so long. Now I could
never go back and face the joshing. I wrote the
captain a letter about it, and he never paid any attention.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Instead of that, he sent me back a bunch
of her letters. Knowing how things stood, what I
was doing and what she thought that I was doing,
I could hardly open them. They made me feel as
small as buckshot in a barrel. They hinted about
being proud of me—and prayed that I’d come home
alive—and I knew, in spite of being ashamed, that
I had her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next thing, the natives got off the reservation.
There’s where Captain Fletcher went clean, plumb
<em>loco</em>. One day the <cite>Leader</cite> came out with circus
scare-heads about the “Hero of Pago Bridge.”
They printed my biography and a picture of me.
It didn’t look like me, but it was a nice picture. I’d
broke through a withering fire and carried a Kansas
lieutenant across to safety after he had been helplessly
wounded—and never turned a hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was I doing all that time? Laying pretty
low. I was afraid to leave town because I wanted
to keep an eye on the <cite>Leader</cite>, which was coming
regularly to the Public Library, and afraid to get a
regular daylight job for fear that somebody from
Striped Rock would come along and see me. I was
nearly busted when I ran onto old Doctor Morgan,
the Indian Root Specialist. He gave me a job as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>his outside man. All I had to do was to hang
around watching for sick-looking strays from the
country. You know the lay. I told them how
Doctor Morgan had cured me of the same lingering
disease and how I was a well man, thanks to
his secrets, babying them along kind of easy until
they went to the doctor. He did the rest, and I
collected twenty-five per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Striped Rock acted as though I was the mayor.
They named their new boulevard Drake Way.
Come Fourth of July, they set me up alongside of
Lincoln. They talked about running me for the
Assembly. There came another bunch of her letters—I
had answered the last lot that Cap sent,
mailed them all the way to the Philippines, to be
forwarded just to gain time—they were heaven
mixed with hell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The regiment was coming back in a week, and
then I began to think it over and cuss myself harder
than ever for a natural-born fool that didn’t have
enough sand to throw up the game at first and go
home and face the music. It was too late then, and
I couldn’t go back to Striped Rock and take all the
glory that was coming to me and face Susie knowing
that I was a fake. Besides, I knew the boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>from Range City were liable to go up to Striped
Rock any time and tell the whole story, and it
froze me, inside. I didn’t know what to do, but the
first thing that I had on hand was to catch them
at the dock and tell them all that it meant to me
and get them to promise that they wouldn’t tell.
Whether I’d dare to go back and try to get Susie,
I couldn’t even think.</p>

<p class='c000'>I threw up my job with the doctor and went
down to the transport office to see just when they
expected the boys. Little house on the dock; little
hole rooms that you could scarcely turn around in.
They said that the boss transport man was in the
next room. I walked in.</p>

<p class='c000'>There—face to face—was Susie—Susie, pinky
and whitey, her eyes just growing and growing. I
couldn’t turn, I couldn’t run, I could just hang tight
onto the door-knob and study the floor. The
transport man went out and left us alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>And she said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Admeh Drake, <em>what</em> are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>My inwards, me saying nothing all the time, said
that I was a fool and a thief and a liar. I could
have lied, told her that I came home ahead of the
regiment, if it had been anyone but Susie. But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>told her the truth, bellowed it out,—because my
soul was burned paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I came out to see you come back,” she said,
and then:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought that I could be proud of you.”
Never another word she said, and she never looked
at me again, but she threw out her hand all of a sudden
and something dropped. It was the play kid-ring
I gave her the night that I wish I had died.</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to talk; I tried to hold the door; I might
as well have tried to talk to the wall. The last I
saw of her, the last that ever I will see, was her
molassesy-gold hair going out of the big gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>I spilled out over the transport man and—O
God—how I cried! I ain’t ashamed of it. You’d
have cried, too. After that—I don’t know what I
did. I walked over a bigger patch of hell than any
man ever did alone. But the regiment’s come and
gone and never found me, and I don’t know why I
ain’t dead along with my insides.</p>

<p class='c000'>And they mustered out at Denver, and the boys
split up and went home. Company N went back
to Range City—cottonwoods shedding along the
creeks, ranges all white on top, sagey smell off the
foot-hills, people riding and driving in from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>ranches by hundreds to see them and cheer them
and feed them and hug them—but there wasn’t
any hero for Striped Rock, because he had bad
eyes and was a darn fool—a darn fool!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE DIMES OF COFFEE JOHN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>“Well,” said the Harvard Freshman, after
the last tale was told, “I’m dead broke,
and my brain seems to have gone out of
business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m broke, and my heart’s broke, too,” said the
Hero of Pago Bridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m broke, similar,” said the ex-medium, “and
my nerves is a-sufferin’ from a severe disruption.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffee John thumped his red fist upon the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bryce up, gents!” he exclaimed. “Remember
there’s nothink in the ryce but the finish, as the
dark ’orse says, w’en ’e led ’em up to the wire!
They’s many a man ’as went broke in this ’ere tarn,
an’ ’as lived to build a four-story ’ouse in the Western
Addition; an’ they’s plenty more as will go broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>afore the trams stop runnin’ on Market Street! This
’ere is a city o’ hextremes, you tyke me word for
thet! It ain’t on’y that Chinatarn is a stone’s throw
from the haristocracy o’ Nob Hill, an’ they’s a corner
grocery with a side entrance alongside of every
Methody chapel. It ain’t on’y that the gals here is
prettier an’ homblier, an’ stryter an’ wickeder than
anyw’eres else in Christendom, but things go up an’
darn every other wye a man can nyme. It’s corffee
an’ sinkers to-dye an’ champyne an’ terrapin to-morrer
for ’arf the people what hits the village.
They’s washwomen’s darters wot’s wearin’ of their

<p class='c000'>And with this philosophic introduction, Coffee
John began</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF BIG BECKY</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>When I fust struck this ’ere port, I was
an yble seaman on the British bark <em>Four
Winds</em> art o’ Iquique, with nitrytes, an’
I was abart as green a lad as ever was plucked.
When I drored the nine dollars that was a-comin’
to me, I went ashore an’ took a look at the tarn, an’
I decided right then that this was the plyce for me.
So I calmly deserts the bark, an’ I ain’t set me foot
to a bloomin’ gang-plank from that dye to this, syvin’
to tyke the ferry to Oakland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Me money larsted abart four dyes. The bleedin’
sharks at the sylor boardin’-’ouse charged five, a
femile in a box at the “Golden West” darnce-hall
got awye with three more, an’ the rest was throwed
into drinks promiscus. The fourth dye in I ’adn’t a
bloomin’ penny to me nyme, an’ I was as wretched
as a cow in a cherry-tree. After abart twelve
hours in “’Ell’s Arf-Acre” I drifted into a dive,
darn on Pacific Street, below Kearney, on the Barbary
Coast, as <em>was</em> the Barbary Coast in them dyes!
It was a well-known plyce then, an’ not like anythink
else wot ever done business that I ever seen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Bottle Myer’s” it was; per’aps yer may have
heard of it? No?</p>

<p class='c000'>Yer went in through a swing door with a brarss
sign on, darn a ’allwye as turned into a corner into
a wider plyce w’ere the bar was, an’ beyond that
to a ’all that might ’ave ’eld, I should sye, some sixty
men or thereabart. The walls was pynted in a blue
distemper, but for a matter of a foot or so above
the floor there was wot yer might call a dydo o’
terbacker juice, like a bloomin’ coat o’ brarn pynte.
The ’all smelled full strong o’ fresh spruce sawdust
on the floor, an’ the rest was whiffs o’ kerosene ile,
an’ sylor’s shag terbacker an’ style beer, an’ the
combination was jolly narsty! Every man ’ad ’is
mug o’ beer on a shelf in front of ’is bench, an’ the
parndink of ’em after a song was somethink awful.
On a bit of a styge was a row of performers in farncy
dress like a nigger minstrel show, an’ a beery little
bloke sat darn in front, bangin’ a tin-pan pianner,
reachin’ for ’is drink with one ’and occysional,
withart leavin’ off plyin’ with the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, after a guy ’ad sung “All through a lydy
wot was false an’ fyre,” an’ one o’ the ’ens ’ad
cracked art “Darn the lyne to Myry,” or somethink
like that, Old Bottle Myer, ’e got up, with a ’ed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>like a cannon-ball an’ cock eyes an’ eyebrars like
bits o’ thatch, an’ a farncy flannel shirt, an’ ’e says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If any gent present wants to sing a song, he can;
an’ if ’e don’t want to, ’e don’t ’ave to!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nar, I wa’n’t no singer myself, though I ’ad piped
occysional, to me mytes on shipboard, but I thought
if I couldn’t do as well as them as ’ad myde us suffer,
I ought to be jolly well ashymed o’ meself.
Wot was more to the point, I didn’t ’ave the price
of a pot o’ beer to bless myself with, an’ thinks I,
this might be a charnst to pinch a bit of a ’aul. So
I ups an’ walks darn to the styge, gives the bloke
at the pianner a tip on the chune, an’ starts off on
old “Ben Bobstye.” They was shellbacks in the
audience quite numerous as I seen, an’ it done me
good to ’ear ’em parnd their mugs after I’d gort
through. W’en I picked up the abalone shell like
the rest of ’em done, an’ parssed through the ’all,
wot with dimes an’ two-bit pieces I ’ad considerable,
an’ I was natchurly prard o’ me luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Bottle Myer come up an’ says, “’Ow much
did you myke, me friend? Five fifteen, eh? Well,
me charge will be on’y a dollar this time, but if yer
want to come rarnd to-morrow night, yer can. If
yer do all right, I’ll tyke yer on reg’lar.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Well, I joined the comp’ny sure enough, an’ sung
every night, pickin’ up a feerly decent livin’ at the
gyme, for it was boom times then, an’ money was
easier to come by. I had me grub with all the
other hartists in a room they called the “Cabin,” darn
below the styge, connected to a side dressin’-room
by a narrer styre. Nar, one o’ the lydies in the
comp’ny was the feature o’ the show, an’ she <em>were</em>
a bit out o’ the ord’n’ry, I give you <em>my</em> word!</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a reg’lar whyle of a great big trouncin’
Jew woman as ever I see. Twenty stone if she
were an arnce, an’ all o’ six foot two, with legs like
a bloomin’ grand pianner w’en she put on a short
petticoat to do a comic song. She was billed as
“Big Becky,” an’ by thet time she was pretty well
known abart tarn.</p>

<p class='c000'>She ’ad started in business in San Francisco at the
hextreme top o’ the ’Ebrew haristocracy of the
Western Addition, ’avin ’parssed ’erself off for a
member o’ one o’ the swellest families o’ St. Louis,
an’ she did cut a jolly wide swath here, an’ no dart
abart thet! She was myde puffickly at ’ome everyw’eres,
an’ flashed ’er sparklers an’ ’er silk garns
with the best o’ ’em. Lord, it must ’ave took yards
o’ cloth to cover ’er body! Well, she gort all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>nobs into line, an’ ’ad everythink ’er own wye for
abart two months, as a reg’lar full-blowed society
favoryte. Day an’ night she ’ad a string o’ men
after ’er, or ’er money, w’ich was quite two things,
seein’ she ’ad to graft for every penny she bloomin’
well ’ad.</p>

<p class='c000'>W’ile she were at the top notch of the social
w’irl, as you might sye, along come another Jewess
from the East, reckernized ’er, an’ spoils Big
Becky’s gyme, like a kiddie pricks a ’ole in a pink
balloon. She was showed up for a hadventuress,
story-book style, wot ’ad ’oodwinked all St. Louis
a year back, an’ then ’er swell pals dropped awye
from ’er like she was a pest-’ouse. Them wot ’ad
accepted ’er invites, an’ ’ad ’er to dinner an’ the
theatre an’ wot-not, didn’t myke no bones abart it—they
just natchully broke an’ run. Then all
sorts o’ stories come art, ’ow she borrowed money
’ere, there an’ everyw’ere, put ’er nyme to bad
checks, an’ fleeced abart every bloomin’ ’Ebrew in
tarn. She’d a bin plyin’ it on the grand, an’ on the
little bit too grand.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was on trial for abart two dyes, an’ the city
pypers was so full o’ the scandal that the swells she
’oodwinked ’ad to leave tarn till it blew over, an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>San Francisco quit larfin at ’em. I give yer me
word the reporters did give art some precious rycy
tyles, an’ every ’Ebrew wot ’ad ’ad Big Becky at a
five o’clock tea didn’t dyre go art o’ doors dye-times.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, for the syke o’ ’ushin’ matters up, her cyse
were compromised an’ the prosecution withdrawed,
she bein’ arsked in return to git art o’ tarn. Instead
o’ thet, not ’avin’ any money, she went an’ accepted
an offer from a dime museum here, an’ begun
fer to exhibit of ’erself in short skirts every
afternoon an’ evenink reg’lar, to the gryte an’ grand
delight of every chappie who ’adn’t been fooled
’imself. After that she done “Mazeppa” at the
Bella Union Theatre in a costume wot was positively
’orrid. It was so rude that the police interfered,
an’ thet was back ten year ago, w’en they
wa’n’t so partickler on the Barbary Coast as they
be naradyes. Then she dropped darn to Bottle
Myer’s an’ did serios in tights. She was as funny
as a bloomin’ helephant on stilts, if so yer didn’t see
the plyntive side of it, an’ we turned men awye
from the door every night.</p>

<p class='c000'>I don’t expect Becky ever ’ad more’n a spoonful o’
conscience. But with all ’er roguery, she was as
big a baby inside as she were a giant outside, w’en
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>yer onct knew ’ow to tyke ’er, was Big Becky.
’Ard as brarss she was w’en yer guyed ’er, but soft
as butter w’en yer took ’er part, w’ich were somethink
as she weren’t much used to, for most treated
’er brutle. Some’ow I couldn’t help likin’ ’er a bit,
in spite o’ meself. I put in a good deal o’ talk
with ’er, one wye an’ another, till I ’ad ’er confidence,
an’ could get most anythink art of ’er I
wanted. She told me ’er whole story, bit by bit,
an’ it were a reg’lar shillin’ shocker, I give yer <em>my</em>
word!</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst other things, she told me that a Johnnie
in tarn nymed Ikey Behn ’ad gort precious
balmy over ’er, before she was showed up, an’ ’ad
went so far as to tyke art a marriage license in
’opes, when she seen ’e meant biz, she’d marry ’im.
’E’d even been bloomin’ arss enough to give it to
’er, and she ’ad it yet, an’ was ’oldin’ it over ’is ’ed
for blackmyle, if wust come to wust. She proposed
for to ’ave a parson’s nyme forged into the
marriage certificate that comes printed on the other
side from the license.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nar, things bein’ like this, one night I come up
the styre from the “Cabin” w’ere I’d been lyte to
dinner, an’ went into the room w’ere Becky was a-gettin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>ready to dress for ’er turn. There was a
toff there, in a topper, an’ a long black coat, an’ ’e
was havin’ it art, ’ot an’ ’eavy, with Becky. Just
as I come up, ’e broke it off, cursink ’er something
awful, an’ she was as red as a bleedin’ ’am, an’
shykin’ a herthquyke with ’er ’air darn, an’ ’er
breath comin’ like a smith’s bellus. The gentleman
slum the door, an’ she says to me, “’Ere, Jock, old
man, will yer do me a fyvor? Just ’old this purse
o’ mine an’ keep it good an’ syfe till I get through
my song, for that’s Ikey Behn wot just went art,
an’ ’e’ll get my license sure, if I leave it abart. I
carn’t trust nobody in this ’ole but you. It’s in
there,” an’ she showed me the pyper, shovin’ the
purse into me ’and. I left an’ went darn front
w’ile she put on ’er rig an’ done ’er turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Art in the bar, there was the toff, talkin’ to one
o’ the wyters, an’ I knew ’e was tryin’ to tip somebody
to frisk Big Becky’s pockets. W’en I come
up, ’e says, “’Ow de do, me man? I sye, ’ave a
glarss with me, won’t yer? Wot’ll yer ’ave?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I marked ’is gyme then an’ there, an’ I sat darn
to see ’ow ’e’d act. ’E done it ’andsome, ’e did;
’e was a thoroughbred, an’ no mistake abart <em>thet</em>!
’E wan’t the bloke to drive a bargain like most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>would ’ave done under the syme irritytin’ circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See ’ere,” ’e says, affable, an’ ’e opens ’is wallet
an’ tykes art a pack o’ bills. “’Ere’s a tharsand
in ’undred-dollar greenbacks. You get me that
pyper Big Becky’s got in ’er purse!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There I was, sittin’ right in front of ’im, with
the license in me pocket, an’ there was a fortune
in front o’ me as would ’ave set me up in biz for
the rest o’ me life. Wot’s more, if they’s anythink
I do admire, it’s a thoroughbred toff, for I was
brought up to reckernize clarss, an’ I seen at a
wink that this ’ere Johnnie was a dead sport. I
knew wot it meant to ’im to get possession o’ thet
pyper, for Becky could myke it jolly ’ot for ’im
with it. I confess, gents, thet for abart ’alf a mo I
hesityted. But I couldn’t go back on the woman,
seem’ she ’ad trusted me partickler, an’ so I shook
me ’ed mournful, an’ refused the wad.</p>

<p class='c000'>’E was a bit darn in the mouth at thet, not
lookin’ to run up agin such, in a plyce like Bottle
Myer’s, I expeck. “See ’ere, me man,” ’e says,
“I just <em>gort</em> to ’ave thet pyper. I’ll tell yer wot,
w’en I gort art thet license, I swyre I thought the
woman was stryte an’ all she pretended to be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>We was all of us took in. I wa’n’t after ’er
money, I was plum balmy on ’er, sure, an’ nar I’m
engyged to the nicest little gal as ever lived, an’
it’ll queer the whole thing if this ’ere foolishness
gets art!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With my respeck for the haristocracy, I was
jolly sorry for the chap, but I wa’n’t a-goin’ to sell
Becky art, not <em>thet</em> wye. I wa’n’t no holy Willie,
but I stuck at that. So I arsked, “Wot’s the gal’s
nyme?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s none of your biz,” says Behn, gettin’ ’ot
in the scuppers, “an’ that little gyme won’t do yer
no good, nohow, for the gal knows all abart this
matter, ’an yer can’t trip me up there. Not much.
I’ll pye yer all the docyment’s worth, if yer’ll get it
for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yer won’t get it art o’ Becky not at no price,”
I says, “an’ yer won’t get it art o’ me, unless yer
answer my questing. If yer want me to conduck
this ’ere affyre, I got to know all abart it, an’ yer
gal won’t be put to no bother, neither.”</p>

<p class='c000'>’E looked me over a bit, an’ then ’e says, low,
so that nobody couldn’t ’ear, “It’s Miss Bertha
Wolfstein.” Then ’e give me ’is address, ’an left
the matter for me to do wot I could.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>I thought if anybody could work Becky, it would
be me, an’ I expected the gal’s nyme might come
in ’andy, though I ’ad no idea then how strong it
would pull. So I goes up to the big woman after
she was dressed, and tykes ’er up to the “Poodle
Dog” for supper. She ’ad gort over the worry by
this time, an’ was feelink as chipper as a brig in a
west wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did ever yer ’ear tell of a Bertha Wolfstein?”
I says, off-hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then wot does she do but begins to bryke darn
an’ blubber. “She was the on’y one in tarn as
come to see me after I was pulled,” she says. “I
done all kinds o’ fyvors for lots of ’em, but Miss
Wolfstein was the on’y one who ’ad called me
friend, as ever remembered it. She was a lydy,
was Miss Wolfstein; she treated me angel w’ite,
she did, Gawd bless ’er pretty fyce!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I knowed I ’ad ’er w’ere I wanted ’er, ’an
I give it to ’er tender an’ soft, with all the sugar an’
cream she could stand. I let art Ikey Behn’s story,
hinch by hinch, an’ I pynted the feelinks o’ thet
Bertha Wolfstein with all the tack I knew how, till
I gort Becky on the run an’ she boohooed again,
right art loud, an’ I see I ’ad win ’er over. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>word! she <em>did</em> look a sight for spectytors after
she’d wiped a ’arf parnd o’ pynte off’n ’er fyce with
’er napkin, sobbink awye, like ’er ’eart was as soft
as a slug in a mud-puddle. She parssed over the
pyper art of ’er purse an’ she says, “Yer can give
it to Ikey an’ get the money. I don’t want to ’urt
a ’air o’ thet gal’s ’ead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Seein’ she was so easy worked, I thought it was
on’y right I should be pyde for me trouble, for
it ’ad stood me somethink for a private room an’
drinks an’ such to get her into proper condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I says, “Thet’s all right, Becky, an’ it’s jolly
’andsome o’ yer to be willin’ to let go of the docky-ment,
but I’ll be blowed if I see ’ow yer can tyke
’is money, w’en yer feel that wye. If yer sell art
the pyper, w’ere does the bloomin’ gratitude to the
gal come in, anywye?”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this, Becky looked all wyes for a Sunday, an’
I perceeded to rub it in. “Nar, see here, Becky,
w’ich would yer rather do—get five ’undred dollars
for the license from Ikey, or let Miss Wolfstein
know yer’d made a present of it to ’er, for wot she
done to yer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was a ’ard conundrum for a woman like
that, who ’ad fleeced abart every pal she ever ’ad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>an’ the money was a snug bit for anybody who was
as ’ard up as she was then. I thought I’d mark
the price darn a bit so’s to myke the sacrifice easier
for ’er. I didn’t dyre to trust her with a offer of
the tharsand Ikey ’ad flashed at me. Besides, I
thought I see a charnst to myke a bit meself withart
lyin’. Sure enough, I ’ad read the weather in ’er
fyce all right, an’ she was gyme to lose five ’underd
just to sye “thank you,” as yer might sye. I farncy
I’d found abart the only spot in ’er ’eart as wa’n’t
rotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I guess I’d rather ’ave ’er know I ain’t quite so
bad as they think,” she says, an’ she gulluped an’
rubbed ’er eyes. “You go to Ikey, an’ you tell
’im ’e’s a—” Well, I won’t sye wot she called ’im.
“But Bertha Wolfstein is the on’y lydy in tarn, an’
it’s on’y for ’er syke I’m givin’ up the license.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she kerflummuxed again, an’ if yer think
I left her time to think it over, yer don’t know old
John. I took the pyper before the words was feerly
art of ’er marth, an’ in ’arf an’ ’our I was pullin’
Ikey Behn’s door-bell. When ’e seen me, ’e
grinned like a cat in a cream-jug, an’ ’e arsked me
into the li’bry like I was a rich uncle just ’ome
from the di’mond fields.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Nar, yer might think as I was a-goin’ to try to
sell ’im the pyper on me own account, leavin’ ’im to
think that Becky was gettin’ the price of it, an’ me
a percentage. Not much I wa’n’t; not on yer
blessed life! I was too clever for thet! I’ve seen
reel toffs before, an’ I knew Ikey for best clarss
when I piped ’im off. ’Ave yer ever watched the
bootblacks in Piccadilly Circus? D’yer think they
has a trades-union price for a shine? Nar! W’en
a bleedin’ swell comes along an’ gits a polish an’
arsks ’ow much, it’s “Wot yer please, sir,” an’ “I
leave it to you, sir,” an’ the blackie gits abart four
times wot ’e’d a-dared to arsk, specially if the toff’s
a bit squeegee. That’s the on’y wye to treat a
gentleman born, an’ I knew it. So I tipped ’im off
the stryte story, leavin’ nothing art to speak of, an’
’e listens affable. I ’ands ’im over the license at
the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>W’en ’e’d stuck the pyper in a candle ’andy, an’
’ad lighted a big cigar with it, offerink the syme an’
a drink to me, ’e says, as cool as a pig before
Christmas, says ’e, “Nar, me man, wot d’yer want
for yer trouble? Yer done me a fyvor, an’ no dart
abart <em>thet</em>!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No trouble at all,” I says. “I’m proud to
oblige such a perfeck gentleman as you be,” an’ with
that I picks up me ’at an’ walks toward the door.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Wyte a bit,” ’e says, “I’ll see if I ain’t gort a
dollar on me,” an’ ’e smiles cordial. But ’e watches
me fyce sharp, too, as I seen in the lookin-glarss.
Then ’e goes to a writin’-desk an’ looks in a dror.
“If happen yer don’t want any o’ this yerself, yer
can give it to Becky,” he says, an’ ’e seals up
a packet an’ gives it to me like ’e was the bloomin’
Prince o’ Wyles. Sure, ’e <em>was</em> toff, clean darn to
’is boot-pegs, I give yer <em>my</em> word!</p>

<p class='c000'>When I gort out o’ doors an’ opened the packet,
I near fynted awye. They was a wad o’ hundreds
as come to a cool four tharsand dollars. I walked
back on the bloomin’ hatmosphere!</p>

<p class='c000'>I come into Bottle Myer’s, just as Big Becky was
a-singin’ “Sweet Vylets,” in a long w’ite baby rig
an’ a bunnit as big as a ’ogshead. Lord, old Myer
<em>did</em> myke a guy o’ thet woman somethink awful!
W’en she come off, I was wytin’ in the dressin’-room
for ’er.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My Lawd, Jock!” she says, w’en she seen me,
“yer didn’t give up the pyper, did yer? Yer
knew I was on’y foolin’, didn’t yer? Don’t sye
yer let Ikey get a-hold of it! It was good for a
hunderd to me any dye I needed the money, if I
wanted to give it to the pypers.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Well, that myde me sick, though I’d expecked
as much. I was thet disgusted thet she couldn’t
stand by ’er word for a hour, thet I couldn’t ’elp
syin’, “An’ ’ow abart Miss Wolfstein, as was a
friend to yer, w’en all the other women in tarn
went back on yer, Becky? Yer know wot <em>she’ll</em>
think of yer, don’t yer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Right then I seen abart as plucky a fight between
good an’ bad worked art on ’er fyce, as I
ever seen in the ring, London Prize rules to a finish.
An’ if you’ll believe it, gents, the big woman’s gratitude
to the Wolfstein gal come art on top, an’ the
stingy part of ’er was knocked art flat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It were a tough battle, though, I give yer <em>my</em>
word, before I got the decision. She bit ’er lip
till the blood come through the rouge, standin’ there,
a great whoopin’ big mounting o’ flesh with baby
clothes an’ a pink sash on, an’ a wig an’ bunnit like
a bloomin’ Drury Lyne Christmas Pantymime. I
just stood an’ looked at ’er! I’m blowed if she didn’t
git almost pretty for ’alf a mo, w’en she says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m glad yer did give it up, Jock; I’m glad,
nar it’s all over. But thet five hundred would ’ave
syved me life, for old Myer ’as give me the sack
to-dye, an’ I don’t know wot’ll become o’ me.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Wot did I do? I done wot the dirtiest sneak
in the Pen would a did, an’ ’anded art the envelope
an’ split the pile with ’er.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Coffee John fetched a deep sigh. “Well, gents,
thet’s w’ere I got me start. The wad didn’t larst
long, for I was green an’ unused to money, but I
syved art enough to set me up here, an’ ’ere I am
yet. I never seen Big Becky sinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nar you see wot a man might ’appen to strike
in a tarn like this. Every bloomin’ dye they’s somebody
up an’ somebody darn. I started withart a
penny, an’ I pulled art a small but helegant fortune
in a week’s time. So can any man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gents, I give you this stryte: Life in San
Francisco is a bloomin’ fayry tyle if a man knows
’is wye abart, an’ a bloke can bloomin’ well blyme
’is own liver if ’e carn’t find a bit of everythink ’ere
’e wants, from the Californy gal, w’ich is the noblest
work o’ Gawd, to the ’Frisco flea, w’ich is a bleedin’
cousin to the Old Nick ’isself! They ain’t no tarn
like it, they ain’t never been none, an’ they ain’t never
goin’ to be. It ain’t got neither turf nor trees nor
kebs, but it’s bloody well gort a climate as mykes
a man’s ’eart darnce in ’is bussum, an’ cable-cars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>wot’ll tyke a guy uphill to ’eaven or rarnd the
bloomin’ next corner to ’ell’s cellar! They’s every
sin ’ere except ’ypocrisy, for that ain’t needed, an’
they’s people wot would ’ave been synted if they’d
lived in ancient times.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ nar, I want to egspress somethink of wot
I thinks o’ you bums. As fur as I can see every
one o’ yer is a ’ard cyse, ’avin’ indulged in wot yer
might call questingable practices, withart yet bein’,
so to speak, of the criminal clarss. It don’t go to
myke a man particklerly prard o’ ’umanity to keep
a dime restaurant; ’arrivver, ’Evving knows wot I’d
do if I couldn’t sometimes indulge in the bloomin’
glow of ’ope. Vango, I allar you’ll be a bad ’un,
and I don’t expeck to make a Sunday-school superintendent
o’ yer. Coffin uses such lengwidge as
mykes a man wonder if ’e ain’t a bleedin’ street
fakir on a ’arf-’oliday, so I gives ’im up frankly an’
freely an’ simply ’opes for the best. But you,
Dryke, is just a plyne ornery lad as ’as ’ad ’is eart
broke, an’ you ’as me sympathy, as a man with
feelinks an’ a conscience.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nar, I’ll tell yer wot I’ll do. I’ll styke the three
of yer a dime apiece, an’ yer git art o’ ’ere with the
firm intentions o’ gettin’ rich honest. Mybe yer won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>myke it, an’ then again mybe yer will, but it’s a good
gamble an’ I’d like to have it tried art. Anywye,
come back ’ere to-morrow at nine, an’ ’ave dinner
on me, ’an tell me all abart it. Wot d’yer sye?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a psychological moment. The proposition,
fantastic as it was, seemed, under the spell of
Coffee John’s enthusiasm, to promise something
mysteriously new, something grotesquely romantic.
It was a chance to turn a new leaf. The three
vagabonds were each stranded at a turn of the
tide. The medium, with his nerves unstrung, was
only too willing to cast on Fate the responsibility of
the next move. The Harvard Freshman, with no
nerves at all, one might say, hailed the adventure
as a Quixotic quest that would be amusing to put to
the hazard of chance. The hero of Pago Bridge
had little spirit left, but, like Vango, he welcomed
any fortuitous hint that would tell him which way
to turn in his misery. All three were well worked
upon by the solace of the moment, and a full
stomach makes every man brave. Coffee John’s
appeal went home, and from the sordid little shop
three beggars went forth as men. One after the
other accepted the lucky dime and fared into the
night, to pursue the firefly of Fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>In ten minutes the restaurant was dark and
empty, and Coffee John was snoring in a back room.
Three Picaroons were busy at the Romance of
Roguery.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE HARVARD FRESHMAN’S ADVENTURE: THE FORTY PANATELAS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>James Wiswell Coffin, 3d, was the
first of the three adventurers to leave the restaurant,
and as he turned up Kearney Street he
had a new but fully fledged philosophy buzzing in
his brain. Enlightenment had come in a hint
dropped by Coffee John himself. It took a Harvard
man and a Bostonian of Puritan stock to hatch
that chick of thought, but, by the time the coffee
was finished, the mental egg broke and an idea
burst upon him. It was this:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Facts show that good luck is stable for a while
and is then followed by a run of misfortune. The
mathematical ideal of alternate favorable and unfavorable
combinations does not often occur. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>is where the great Law of Probabilities falls down
hard. The curve of fortune is like a wave. It
should then be played heavily while it ascends, and
lightly on the decline. Mine is undoubtedly rising.
Go to! I shall proceed to gamble!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But how gamble at midnight with a capital of
but one dime? In no other city in the world is it
so easy as in San Francisco, that quaint rendezvous
of saloons and cigar stands. There the goddess
Fortuna has a shrine on every street corner and the
offerings of her devotees produce a rattle as characteristic
of the town as the slap of the cable pulley
in the conduit of the car lines. The cigar slot-machine
or “hard-luck-box” is a nickel lottery
played by good and bad alike; for it has a reputation
no shadier than the church-raffle or the juvenile
grab-bag, and is tolerated as a harmless
safety-valve for the lust of gaming. All the same,
it is the perpetual ubiquitous delusion of the amateur
sportsman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gunschke’s cigar shop was still open as Coffin
reached the corner of Brush Street. He walked
briskly inside the open sales-room (for a cigar shop
has but three walls in San Francisco’s gentle clime)
and, with the assurance of one who has just touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>a humpback and the carelessness of a millionaire,
he exchanged Coffee John’s dime for two nickels,
dropped one down the slot of the machine on the
counter and sprang the handle. The five wheels
of playing-cards whirled madly, then stopped, leaving
a poker-hand exposed behind the wire. He
had caught a pair of kings, good for a “bit”
cigar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin was disappointed, and yet, after all, there
was a slight gain in the transaction. Investing five
cents, he had won twelve and a half cents’ worth
of merchandise. It was not sufficiently marvellous
to turn his head, but his luck was evidently on the
up-curve, though it was rising slowly enough. He
took the other nickel—his last—and jerked the
handle again, awaiting with calmness for the cards
to come to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the wheels settled into place a man with
green eyes and a bediamonded shirt front came up
and leaned over Coffin’s shoulder. “Good work!
A straight flush, by crickety!—forty cigars! Get
in and break the bank, young fellow!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin turned to him with nonchalance, while the
clerk marked the winning in a book. “Nn—nn!
I know when I’ve got enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Play for me then, will you?” the other rejoined.
“You’ve got luck, you have!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t propose to make a present of it to you, if
I have; I need every stitch of it myself.” And
then Coffin, touched with a happy thought, began
to swagger. “Besides, if I’m going to smoke this
forty up to-night I’ve got to get busy with myself.”
He looked knowingly at the goods displayed
for his choice, pinching the wrappers. “I’ve
never had all the cigars I could smoke yet, and
I’m going to try my limit. Got any Africana
Panatelas, Colorado Maduro?” he asked the
clerk. A small box was taken down from the
shelf. Coffin accepted it and walked leisurely
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Lord!” cried the stranger, following
him. “You don’t think you can tackle forty cigars
on a stretch, do you? Kid, it’ll kill you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a beautiful death,” Coffin replied, jauntily,
“you can tell mamma I died happy.” The cigar
clerk grinned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strikes me you’re troubled with youngness,”
said the stranger, looking him over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin ruffled at his patronizing tone. “See
here! D’you think I can’t get away with these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>forty cigars, smoking ’em in an end-to-end chain
down to one-inch butts?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I bet you a hundred dollars you get sick as a
pig first!” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Taken!” Coffin cried, and went at him with
fire in his eye. “See here, I left all my money on
my grand piano, but if you’ll trust me I’ll trust you
without stakes held. We’ll get the clerk here to
see fair play, and if I don’t see this box to a finish
or pay up, you two can push the face off me.
What d’you say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The green-eyed stranger, who had evidently
money to spend foolishly, and a night to waste in
doing it, assented jovially. It is not hard to organize
an impromptu trio for any hair-brained purpose
whatever in that land of careless comradeship. The
two waited till the clerk had put up the screen at
the front of the shop, and then walked with him
round to California Street. Half way up the first
block stood an old-fashioned wooden house painted
drab, with green blinds, in striking contrast to the
high brick buildings that surrounded it. The frame
had been brought round Cape Horn in ’49, and, in
pioneer days, the place had been one of the most
fashionable boarding-houses in town. Chinatown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>now crowded it in; it had fallen into disrepute, and
was visited only by the poorer class of foreigners.
Over the entrance was a sign bearing the inscription,
“Hotel de France.” Here the salesman had
a room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lower part of the house was dark, but in
answer to a prolonged ringing of the bell, a small
boy appeared and, with many comments in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i>
of the Bas Pyrenees, lighted two lamps in the barroom.
The three men sat down and took off their
coats and collars for comfort. James Wiswell
Coffin, 3d, opened the box of Panatelas and regarded
them with a sentimental eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>He bit the end off the first cigar and struck a
match. Then he bowed to the company with the
theatrical air of a man about to touch off a loaded
bomb. “Gentlemen, I proceed to take my degree
of Bachelor of Nicotine, if I don’t flunk.” He lighted
the tobacco, quoting, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave, Caesar! Morituri te
salutant!</span></i>” and blew forth a ring of smoke. It
floated upward, smooth and even, hovered over his
head a moment like a halo, then, writhing, scattered
and drifted away. Coffin removed the cigar from
his mouth and looked thoughtfully at the ash.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It burns all right,” he said, “I won’t have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>put kerosene on ’em to make ’em go. D’you know
a Panatela always reminds me of a smart, tailor-made
girl. It’s the most slenderly beautiful shape
for a cigar; it’s gracile, by Jove, gracile and jimpriculate—I
got that word in Kentucky. But I chatter,
friends, I am garrulous. Besides I think I have
now said all I know, and it’s your edge, stranger.
How would it do for you to enliven the pink and
frisky watches of the night by narrating a few of
the more inflammable chapters of your autobiography?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus conjured by the imp, the stranger consented
to relate, after a few preliminaries, the following
tale:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE RETURNED KLONDYKER</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>This is pretty near the finish, young fellow,
of the biggest spending jag this town ever saw.
The money cost me sixteen years of tramping
and trading and frozen toes, and then it came
slap, all in a bunch. So easy come, easy go, says I.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was breaking north, the year of the big find,
when I struck hard luck. That’s too long a yarn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to tell. But the end was that I landed two hundred
miles from Nowhere, cracked in the head from behind
and left for dead in the snow. The Malemute
that did it had his finish in Dawson that winter
by the rope route, spoiling the shot I was saving
for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was stooping over, fixing a sled-runner, when—biff!...
I woke up in an Indian hut filled
with smoke. The whole works were buzzing round,
and a lot of big husky bucks and squaws grunting
over me. I was for getting up and cleaning
them out, but I hadn’t the strength. For a month
I was plum nutty. But every little while, when
my head cleared, I’d look up to see a good-natured
looking brown girl with black eyes taking
care of me as carefully as if she was a trained
nurse.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I got over the fever slowly, I made out, she
telling me in Chinook, that she had found me half
frozen to death, and had carried me fifty miles by
sled. How she did it the Lord only knows. Maybe
it was because she was gone on me, which I
oughtn’t to say, neither, but she sure was. I did a
heap of thinking. She had grit and gentleness, and
the feelings of a lady, which is what every woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that calls herself such hasn’t got, and the more I
saw of her the better I liked her. So when I got
well I had a pow-wow with her father, who was
chief of the tribe, and I bought her for ten dogs
on tick and my gun, which the durned thief had
forgot in the mix-up, and sixty tin tags I’d been saving
from plucks of tobacco to get a free meerschaum
pipe with. We were married Indian fashion, which
is pretty easy, and she came and lived with me in
my hut.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since then I’ve had plenty of the stuff that’s
supposed to make a man happy, but I’m blowed if
I was ever happier than I was that winter, living
with the tribe and married to Kate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, that winter was over with at last. It came
spring, or what you might call such, with the ice
beginning to melt and the sun getting up for a little
while every day, lighter and lighter. One day Kate
and I went fishing. She pulled in her line and I
saw something that made me forget I was an
Indian, adopted into the tribe, all regular. Her
sinker was a gold nugget as big as the fist on a
papoose!</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew it the minute I laid my eyes on it,
though it was all black with water and weather.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>I grabbed it and cut it. It was as soft as lead,
reddish yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where did you ever get that?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Up by the Katakoolanat Pass,” she said, unconcerned-like,
as if it was pig-iron. “I picked it
up because it was heavy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you find the place again?” I asked her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She studied a while. But the Indians never
forget anything. It’s book-learning that makes you
forget. I knew she’d remember before she got
through, and she did. She took her fish-line and
laid it out in funny curves and loops on the top of
the snow like a map, knotting it here and there to
show places she knew, mountain-peaks, lakes and
such-like. Then she pointed out the way with
her finger. She had it down fine. When she got
done she looked up to me with a grin and said:
“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it came to me all of a sudden that she had
no idea of the worth of her find. This was before
the big rush, and her tribe didn’t see white men
more than twice a year. Their regular hunting
grounds were far to the north. They traded skins
and dogs and fish once in a while with traders,
and got beads and truck in return. With the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Indians they made change by strings of wampum
they call alligacheeks. She had no idea of the value
of gold, and she’d never seen a piece of money in
her life. But I didn’t stop to explain then.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come on,” I said, “we’re going to borrow dogs,
and sled north to the Katakoolanat country for
sure!” She never said a word, but packed up and
followed, the way she was trained to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the place the third day, just like she
said we would. Lord, that was a bonanza all right!
You could dig out nuggets with a stick. It was the
Katakoolanat diggings you may have heard about.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I had staked out my claims, two prospectors
got wind of it and started the rush. I got
our band to move up and help me hold my rights,
and when some Seattle agents offered me four hundred
thousand dollars for my claims, I took it, you
bet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing I did after that was to pay back
a hundred dogs for the ten I had promised for Kate;
then I bought up all the provisions I could get
hold of—eggs a dollar apiece, bacon five dollars
a pound—and I fed our band of Indians till they
couldn’t hold any more. It was Kate brought me
the luck, and I felt the winnings were more hers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>than mine. There wasn’t anything too good for
her. When a Scandihoovian missionary came up
to the place we went and got married white fashion,
for I wanted my wife to be respected, and
after that I always insisted that everybody should
call her Mrs. Saul Timney, which made her feel
about six foot high every time she heard it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, sir, Kate was a study in those times. She
couldn’t quite get it through her head for a good
while why we could put it over the rest of ’em the
way we did. The more I got for her, the more
puzzled she was. I recall the first time she ever
saw money passed. It was when I bought the
dogs. I was paying twenty-dollar gold pieces out
of a sack, and she asked me what they were. She
thought they were stones, because they looked more
than anything else like the flat, round pebbles she
had seen on the beach, the kind you throw to skip
on the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’re just all alligacheek,” I said; then, partly
for the joke on her, I said, “Good medicine (meaning
magic); you can get anything you want with
’em!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me some,” said Kate, not quite believing
me, for it was a pretty big story to swallow, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to her ideas, so I handed her over a stack
of twenties.</p>

<p class='c000'>She took them and went out to try the magic.
Going up to the first man she met, she held out the
whole lot to him, asking him for his slicker. When
I came up and said it was all right, he peeled it
right off and handed it over to her, grabbing the
money quick. That was a new one on her, and
she couldn’t quite believe it even then. Well, it was
funny to see the way she acted. She pretty near
bought up everything in camp she took a fancy to,
just for the fun of seeing the magic work, and she
was as excited as a kid with a brand new watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>We came out of the country finally, and took a
steamer for San Francisco, for I wanted to see the
old town again and show Kate what big cities
were like, besides giving her the chance to spend
all the money she wanted on togs and jewelry.
We drove up from the wharf in the best turn-out I
could find, and put up at the Palace Hotel in the
bridal suite. The best was none too good for Kate
and me while I was flush.</p>

<p class='c000'>I rather guess we broke the record for spending,
the two weeks we stayed there. I had three or
four cases of champagne open in my room all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>time, and the bell-boys got so they knew they didn’t
have to be asked, but would just pop the cork and
let her fizz. I got a great big music-box that cost
more than a piano, with drums and bells inside, and
we kept it a-going while we were eating, which was
most of the time we weren’t out doing the town. I
blowed myself for an outfit of sparklers, which this
stone here in my shirt-front is the last, sole survivor.
I bought more clothes than I could wear out in ten
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kate went me one better. Gee! She <em>did</em> have
a time! Of course, woman-like, though she was a
squaw, the first thing she thought about, after she
saw white ladies on the wharves, at Skagway, was
clothes. Mrs. Saul Timney had to dress the part,
and she was bound to do it if it half-killed her,
which it did. She bought a whole civilised outfit
of duds at the White House in ’Frisco, and got the
chambermaid to help her into ’em; that’s where
she got the first jolt. It wasn’t so easy as it looked.
She couldn’t walk in the high-heeled shoes they
wear here, and so she kept on moccasins. Corsets
she gave up early in the game. They didn’t show,
anyway, being inside. Finally she got a dressmaker
to rig her up a sort of a loose red dress that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>call a Mother Hubbard. Her favourite cover was an
ermine cape. She bought it because it cost more
than anything else in the fur store. She just splurged
on hats and bonnets. I reckon she had a new one
every day. The thing that tickled her most was
gloves, for her hands were good and little. She
wore white ones all the time. I s’pose it was because
she felt she looked more like an American
woman that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The swell togs she couldn’t wear she bought just
the same. We skated through town like a forest-fire,
me doing the talking and her the picking out.
She got darned near everything that I ever knew
women wore, and a big lot of others I never had
heard of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every time she picked a thing, and pulled out the
yellow boys to pay for it her eyes stuck out. Of
course, not being used to doing business that way, it
looked to her like every clerk behind the counter was
her slave, all ready to give her anything she said.
She never got over her wonder at the “medicine
stones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had to stop in front of every jewelry store she
saw, too, but I couldn’t get her to buy anything worth
wearing. She just turned up her nose at diamonds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and rubies, but at the sight of a cheap string of beads
she went out of her head. She generally wore five
or six necklaces of ’em over her cape. Lord, I
didn’t care, and what she wanted, she got.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, after she’d let the money run away from
her for a couple of weeks, she got tired of the game
and kind of homesick. She begun to pine for cold
weather and ice and all, while I was just beginning
to enjoy the place. I tried to brace her up, and
thinking it might please her to hear the seals bark at
the Cliff House, we drove out there in a hack.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were down to the “White House” store
one day, when I run slap into Flora Donovan, that
used to live next door to us in Virginia City. She
was only a kid when I went north. She’d grown
up into considerable of a woman now, but I knew
her. So I went up to her, and offered to shake
hands. She glared pretty hard till I told her who
I was and how money had come my way. It seems
her folks had struck it rich, too, and she had more
money than she knew what to do with.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Flora caught sight of Kate, staring at her,
behind me, she flopped up one of those spectacles
with handles, and her eyebrows went up at the same
time. She froze like an ice-pack. I allow the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>women didn’t look much alike, but I wouldn’t let
anybody snub my wife if I could help it, so I introduced
them, calling Kate Mrs. Saul Timney, the
way she liked to have me. Flora sprang something
about being “charmed,” and then said she had to be
going. Said she hoped I’d call, but nothing about
Kate, I noticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I followed her off with my eyes, she was so pretty
and high-toned now, the first decent white woman
I’d talked to in years, and, honest—oh, well, hang it,
a man’s got no license to be ashamed of his wife,
but I don’t know—Kate did look kind of funny in
that red Mother Hubbard and the ermine cape and
straw hat, with moccasins and five strings of glass
beads—doggone it, I hated myself for being ashamed
of her, which I wasn’t, really, only somehow she
looked different than she did before.</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to get her away, but she stood stock-still
watching Flora, who had walked off down to the
cloak department at the end of the aisle. But if
Kate don’t want to move, all hell and an iceberg
can’t budge her, and I stood waiting to think how
I’d square myself with her, feeling guilty enough,
though I was just as fond of my wife as ever. All
of a sudden Kate made a break for the counter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>where Flora Donovan was buying a cloak. The
clerks all knew Kate by this time, and the floorwalker
chap would come on the hop-skip-and-a-jump
and turn the shop upside down for her. So when
she came up behind Miss Donovan, and pointed to
three or four expensive heavy cloaks and threw out
a sack of double eagles to pay for ’em, letting the
clerk take out what he wanted, she had everybody
around staring at her, Flora included.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could see well enough what was in Kate’s mind.
She had seen that I was just a little ashamed of her,
for some reason, and that Flora didn’t think she was
in her class. Kate wanted to show that she was the
real thing, and a sure lady, and the only way she
knew how to prove it was to beat Flora at buying.
Kate didn’t exactly want to put it over her,
she only wanted to make good as the wife of Saul
Timney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flora only said: “Your wife has very good
taste, Mr. Timney,” and sailed into the ladies’ underwear
corner. Kate stuck to her like a burr.
She was right at home there, and for about fifteen
minutes it seemed like all the cash-boys in the
world were running in and out packing away white
things, just like Kate was a fairy queen giving orders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>She laid down “medicine stones” on the counter
till the flim-flams and thingumbobs almost dropped
down off the shelves of themselves. I s’pose a man
really has no business to be in a place like that, but
I watched the two of ’em buy. Kate had actually
got Flora going, and both of ’em emptied their
sacks. Then Flora swept out, looking a hole
through me, but never saying a word. I’ve heard
afterward that Miss Donovan was pretty well
known to be close-fisted, and it must have hurt her
some to let go of all that money, just on account of
an Indian squaw. But the clerks behind the counter
nearly went into fits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kate came up to me and said, “I can buy more
things than she can, can’t I?” And I said, “Sure,
you can, Kate; you could buy her right out of
house and home!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked a little relieved then, but I saw she
was jealous, and the worst of it was, I’d given her
license to be. I tried to be as nice as I could, and
bought her another necklace, and took her to see
the kinetoscopes and let her look through the telescope
at the moon, but I saw she was still fretting
about Flora. That night I met a fellow from the
Yukon, and I left Kate at the hotel and made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>night of it. I went to bed with considerable of a
head, and when I woke up, toward noon, Kate
was gone. She didn’t show up till the next day
after that. I learned afterward what happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kate started out bright and early to find Flora.
She had got into a black dress with spangles, patent-leather
shoes, and a hat as big as a penguin. She
carried with her all the cash we had at the hotel,
running into four figures easy. The shopping district
of San Francisco ain’t such a big place, after all,
and Kate and Flora only went to the best and
highest-priced stores, so it wasn’t long before they
met.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as I could find out, Kate didn’t have her
hatchet out at all, this trip, but she was just trying
to make up to Flora, and be nice to her and show
she was ready to get acquainted. You can guess
what happened. Flora tried to pass Kate, but
Kate just stood in the aisle like a house. It was
no use for Flora to try and snub her, for Kate
couldn’t understand the kind of polite slaps in the
face that ladies know how to give. The only thing
was to get rid of her, so Flora up and went out the
front door to her carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kate followed her out to the sidewalk. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Flora got in, Kate got in right alongside, grinning
all over, showing her sack of gold, and trying her
best to be as nice as she could. Flora was clean
flabbergasted. She didn’t want to make a holy
show of herself on the street by calling the police,
and so she told her driver to go home, as the best
way out of it. So they drove to Van Ness Avenue,
Flora throwing conniption fits, she was so mad, and
Kate smiling and talking Chinook, with her big hat
on one ear.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they got to the house, Flora jumped out
and loped up the steps, blazing, and slammed the
door. Kate tried to follow, but her tight dress and
tight shoes were too much for her, and she fell
down. That got Kate’s mad up, and when Kate’s
good and mad she’s a mule. She banged at the
door, but no one opened. So she sat down on the
front doorstep to wait till Flora came out. You
know what Indians are. She was ready to wait
all night. She was used to nights six months long,
and a few hours in a San Francisco fog didn’t
worry her a bit. She took off her shoes, and
loosened her dress, and stuck to the mat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Flora sent out one of the hired help to
drive Kate away. Kate pulled out one of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“medicine stones” that she had always found would
work, and it worked all right. He went in with a
twenty-dollar gold piece and told all the rest of the
help, and they came out one by one and got twenties,
while Kate froze to the doorstep. Then
Flora telephoned for the police, and a copper came
up from the station to put Kate off the steps. He
stopped when she handed him the first twenty.
He put up his club when she brought out two
more, and went back, after telling the Donovans
he couldn’t exceed the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>There she stayed till eight o’clock next morning,
but it finally got through her head that Flora would
never leave while she was there, so Kate decided
to hide out and lay for her. She went across the
street and sat down on the steps of the Presbyterian
church, a couple of blocks away, where she
drew a crowd of kids and nurse-girls, till the cop
on the beat came up and drove ’em away and collected
another pair of twenties.</p>

<p class='c000'>About ten o’clock, Flora, thinking the coast
was clear, came out and got into her carriage. Kate
was ready for her, holding up her skirt in one
hand and her shoes in the other. The carriage
drove off and Kate fell in behind on a little trot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>You know how Indians run; they can keep it up
all day, and you can’t get away from ’em. Flora
saw her, and made the driver whip up.</p>

<p class='c000'>There they went, lickety-split, a swell turn-out,
with Flora yelling at the driver to go faster, and
about half a block behind poor old Kate, right in
the middle of the street, on the car-track, in dinkey
open-work silk stockings, with her shoes in one
hand, going like a steam-engine. Her hat fell off
as she crossed Polk Street, but Lord, she didn’t
care, she had barrels of ’em at the hotel. I guess
they had a clear street all the way. It must have
taken the crowd like a circus parade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The police never caught on till they got to
Kearney Street, and there I was standing, looking
for my wife. A copper came out to nail her for a
crazy woman, but I got there first, and bundled her
into a hack.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we got up to our rooms she was so queer
and strange that for a little while I didn’t know but
she had gone nutty, after all. She never said a
word till she had straightened up her dress and put
on her shoes and got out a new hat. Then she
stood in front of a big looking-glass. Finally she
turned loose on me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“I want to be white and have a thin nose and a
little waist like an American woman. Where can
I get that? How many medicine stones will it take
to make me white?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Kate,” I said, “don’t talk like that, old
girl. You are good enough for me. You can’t
buy all that, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she said, “You don’t like me the way you
like that other woman. How many medicine
stones will it take to make me just as if I was
white?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course I told her I was just as fond of her as
ever, but she wouldn’t have it that way. She asked
me again how much money it would take, and I had
to tell her that the magic was no good for things
like that.</p>

<p class='c000'>That seemed to kind of stun her, and she began
to mope and pine. She went back into her room
and puttered around some. I didn’t have the heart
to follow her and see what she was up to. When
she came out she had on her old loose dress and
her moccasins. Over her head was the same shawl
she wore when she came out of the Klondyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me my medicine stones,” she said to me.
“I want all of them!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>She seemed to feel so sore, I went out and drew
two thousand dollars in twenties and brought ’em
to her in two sacks. She didn’t need to tell me
what was up. She was going back to her own
country and her own people. She was singing the
song of the tribe—“Death on the White Trail”—when
I came in. I was going to stay in ’Frisco.
That was what Kate wanted, and what Kate
wants she gets, every time, if I have the say-so.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened there was a steamer going next
morning, and Kate didn’t leave her room nor
speak to me till it was time to go down to the dock.
I got her ticket and paid the purser to take good
care of her. Even at the last we didn’t do much
talking—what was the use? We both understood,
and her people don’t waste words.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the boat started she stood on the upper
deck looking at me. Then, all of a sudden, she
opened her two sacks of coin and began to throw
the money by handfuls into the Bay, scattering it in
shower after shower of gold till it was all gone.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Well, sir, the Yukon’s the place after all. I’ve
blown in most all of my four hundred thousand, and
what have I got for it? Kate will wait for me, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>same way she waited for Flora Donovan. I’ve got
one little claim I hung on to when I sold out the
rest, and I’ve got the fever again. As soon as I’ve
had my fun out, and that won’t be long, I’ll make
for the snow country.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>And some day, when Kate comes in from the
fishing, she’ll crawl into her hut and find me there,
smoking by the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, with jest and story, the night wore on, and
James Wiswell Coffin 3d pulled steadily at
his cigars. He smoked nervously now, with
a ruthless determination to finish at any hazard.
More than once, in the early morning, he had to
snatch hastily at a biscuit and swallow it to keep
his gorge from rising at his foolhardy intemperance;
but he manfully proceeded with a courage induced
by the firm belief that if he failed, and attempted
to evade payment of his bet, this gentle, green-eyed
Klondyker would make him pay through the nose.
It is not safe, in the West, for a man to wager high
stakes with no assets. The youngster was by no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>means sure of his endurance. Already the weeds
tasted vilely bitter and the fumes choked him pitifully,
but still his sallies and repartees covered his
fears as a shop-girl’s Raglan hides a shabby skirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the watch, he had succeeded in smoking his
first cigar in eleven minutes. Keeping fairly well
to this pace, eight o’clock found him with but four
left in the box. Rather sallow, with a faded, set
grin, still puffing, still chaffing, the Harvard Freshman
was as cool as Athos under fire. The Klondyker
was as excited as a heavy backer at a six-days’-go-as-you-please.
The cigar-clerk had run
out of racy tales and conundrums.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last but three Panatelas remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here,” said the scion of the Puritans, “I
promised to smoke the whole box, didn’t I, and to
keep one lighted all the time? Well, I didn’t say
only one, and so I’m going to make a spurt and
smoke the last three at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Klondyker demurred, and it was left for
the cigar-salesman to decide. Coffin won. Making
a grimace, the young fool, with a dying gasp of
bravado, lighted the three, and while the others
looked on with admiration, puffed strenuously to
the horrid end. When the stumps were so short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that he could hardly hold them between his lips
the salesman pulled out a watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seven hours, twenty-three minutes and six
seconds—Coffin wins!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this the Harvard Freshman toppled and,
dropping prone upon the floor, felt so desperately,
so horribly, ill that for a while his nausea held him
captive. The room went round. After a while
he reeled to his feet and felt the cool touch of gold
that the Klondyker was forcing into his palm. The
ragged clouds of rotting smoke, the lines of bottles
behind the bar, and the sanded floor swam in a
troubled vision, and then his mind righted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were dead game all right, youngster,” the
Klondyker was saying. “I never thought you’d
see it through, but you earned your money. I’ll bet
you never worked harder for a salary, though!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin tried to smile, and drank a half pitcher of
water. “Gentlemen,” he said, solemnly, leaning
against the wall-paper, “one of life’s sweetest
blessings has faded. I have lost one of Youth’s
illusions. I shall never smoke again. There is
nothing left for me to do but join the Salvation
Army and knock the Demon Rum. My heart
feels like a punching-bag after Fitz has finished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>practising with it, and my head is as light as a new-laid
balloon. As for the dark-brown hole where
my mouth used to be—brrrrrh! I move we pass
out for fresh air. Funny, it seems a trifle smoky
here! Wonder why. Come along and see me
skate on the sidewalk. I’m as dizzy as Two-step
Willie at the eleventh extra.” Then he patted the
double eagles in his hand. “Every one of you
little yellow boys has got to go out and get married,
I must have a big family by to-night!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Klondyker gasped. “For Heaven’s sake
you don’t mean to say you’re going to begin again?
You ought to be in the Receiving Hospital right
now. Can you think of anything crazier to do
after this? I’ll back you! I haven’t had so much
fun since I left the Yukon. You’re likely to tip
over the City Hall before night, if I don’t watch
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, well, I can’t quite keep up this pace,
gentlemen,” said the cigar-clerk, “and I have to
open up the shop. I’ll look you up to-night at the
morgue!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He left hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once outside, Coffin’s spirits rose. “I never
really expected to greet yon glorious orb again,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>he said. “Let’s climb up to Chinatown and get
rich.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spending money is my mark; I’m a James P.
Dandy when it comes to letting go of coin. I’m
with you,” said the Klondyker. “Besides, I want
to see how long before our luck changes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Freshman led the way up past St. Mary’s
Church, without heeding the sacred admonition
graved below the dial: “<em>Son, observe the time and
flee from evil!</em>” a warning singularly apposite in
that scarlet quarter of the town. They passed up
the narrow Oriental lane of Dupont Street, the
Chinatown highway, and, as he pointed out the
sights, Coffin discoursed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the back of half these shops the gentle game
of fan-tan is now progressing. Moreover, there
are at least five lotteries running in the quarter that
I know of. To wit: the ’American,’ the ’Lum
Ki,’ the ’New York,’ the ’Ye Wah’ and the ’Mee
Lee Sing.’ I propose to buck the Mongolian tiger
in his Oriental lair and watch the yellow fur fly,
by investing a small wad in a ticket for the half-past-nine
drawing. I worked out a system last
night, while dallying with the tresses of My Lady
Nicotine, and I simply can’t lose unless my luck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>has turned sour. I shall mark said ticket per
said inspiration, and drag down the spoils of war.
Kaloo, kalay, I chortle in my joy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here, then, you let me in on that,” insisted
the Klondyker; “you keep your hundred and salt
it down. You play my money this shot, and I’ll
give you half of what’s made on it. You’re
a mascot to-day, and I’ve earned the right to use
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right; then I agree to be fairy godmother
until the sun sets. But I muchly fear you’ll let the
little tra-la-loo bird out of the cage, with your great,
big, coarse fingers. Never mind, we’ll try it. Here
we are, now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused in front of a smallish Chinese restaurant
on a side street. In the lower windows were
displayed groceries and provisions, raw and cooked,
and from the upper story a painted wooden fretwork
balcony projected, adorned with potted shrubs
and paper lanterns.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Behind this exhibition of split ducks, semi-pigs,
mud-packed eggs from the Flowery Realm, dried
abalones, sugar-cane from far Cathay, preserved
watermelon-rind, candied limes, li-chi nuts, chop
suey, sharks’ fins, birds’ nests, rats, cats, and rice-brandy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>punks, peanut-oil, and passionate pastry,
lurks the peaceful group that makes money for you
while you wait. Above, in red hieroglyphs, you
observe the legend, ’Chin Fook Yen Company.’
This does not indicate the names of the several
members of the firm, as is ordinarily supposed,
but it is the touching and tempting motto, ’Here
Prosperity awaits Everybody, all same Sunlight!’
In the days of evil tidings I once made a bluff at
being a Chinatown guide. It is easy enough; but
I am naturally virtuous, and I was not a success
with the voracious drummer and the incredulous
English globe-trotter. But I picked up a few friends
amongst the Chinks, as you’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They entered, to find a small room, from the centre
of which a brass-stepped staircase rose to the
floor above. On one side of this office was a counter,
behind which sat a fat, sleek Chinaman, industriously
writing with a vertical brush in an account-book,
pausing occasionally to compute a sum upon
the ebony beads of an abacus. He looked up and
nodded at Coffin, and, without stopping his work,
called out several words in Chinese to those upstairs.
The two went past the kitchens on the second floor
to the top story, where several large dining-rooms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>elaborately decorated in carved wood and colored
glass windows, stretched from front to rear. In one
room a group of men, seemingly Eastern tourists,
were seated on teakwood stools at a round table,
drinking tea and nibbling at sugared confections distributed
in numerous bowls. Expatiating upon the
wonders of the place was what seemed to be one
of the orthodox Chinatown guides, pointing with his
slim rattan cane, and smoking a huge cigar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin led the way to a back room, and, looking
carefully to see if he were observed, knocked three
times at an unobtrusive door. Immediately a silken
curtain at the side was raised, disclosing a window
guarded by a wire screen. In an instant it was
dropped again and the door was opened narrowly.
Coffin pushed his friend through, and they found
themselves in a square, box-like closet or hallway.
Here, another door was opened after a similar signal
and inspection by the look-out, and they passed
through.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside this last barrier was a large room painted
a garish blue. About a table in the centre several
Chinamen were assembled, and doors were opening
and shutting to receive or let out visitors. At a
desk in the corner was sitting a thin-faced merchant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>with horn spectacles and long drooping white mustaches.
To him Coffin went immediately and shook
hands. Then he explained something of the workings
of the lottery to the Klondyker. It was decided
to buy a fifteen-dollar ticket, and they received a
square of yellow paper where, within a border, were
printed eighty characters in green ink. Above was
stamped in red letters the words “New York Day
Time.” The price was written plainly across the
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, I’ll mark it,” said Coffin. “You can
mark a ’high-low’ system that is pretty sure to win,
but it’s too difficult for me—I was never much of a
Dazmaraz at the higher mathematics. So I’ll play
a ’straight’ ticket. That is: I mark out ten spots
anywhere I please. There are twenty winning
numbers, and on a fifteen-dollar ticket if I catch five
of them I get thirty dollars; six pays two hundred
and seventy dollars, seven pays twenty-four hundred
dollars, and eight spots pull down the capital prize.
If more than one ticket wins a prize the money is
divided <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro rata</span></i>, so we don’t know what we win till
the tickets are cashed in, downstairs in the office.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took a brush and marked his ten spots, five
above and five below the centre panel, and handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>it to the manager, who wrote his name in Chinese
characters down the margin. There was just time
for this when the ceremony of drawing the winning
numbers began. The manager brought out a cylindrical
bamboo vessel and placed in it the eighty
characters found on the tickets, each written on a
small piece of paper and rolled into a little pill or
ball. Then he looked up at the Klondyker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You likee mix ’em up?” he asked. The
stranger assented, and, having stirred up the pellets,
was gravely handed a dime by the treasurer of the
company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pellets were then drawn forth, one by one,
and placed in four bowls in rotation till all were
disposed of. The manager now nodded to Coffin,
who came up to the table. “You shake ’em
dice?” said the Chinaman. Coffin nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see this die?” he explained to the Klondyker.
“It’s numbered up to four, and the number
decides which bowl contains the lucky numbers
on the ticket. Here goes! <em>Three!</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The third bowl was accordingly emptied, and
the numbers on the pellets of rolled paper were
read off and entered in a book. The Chinese now
began to show signs of excitement. Tickets were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>produced from the pockets of their dark blouses
and were scanned with interest as the winning numbers
were called out one by one. They crowded
to the shoulder of the manager as he unfolded the
pellets, and jabbered unintelligible oaths and blessings
as the characters were revealed. Coffin
beckoned to one who appeared to have no investment,
and showed him the joint ticket, asking him
to point out the spots as they were read. The first
five were unmarked, but then to their delight the
long nail of the Chinaman’s finger pointed to three
spots in succession. In another minute two more
marked characters won, and then, after a series of
failures, the last two numbers read proved to be
Coffin’s selection. The Chinaman’s eyes snapped,
and he cried out a few words, spreading the news
over the room. In an instant the two white men
were surrounded, and a babel of ejaculations
began.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What the devil does it mean? Do we win?”
asked the Klondyker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do we win! Can a duck swim? We’ve
got seven lucky spots! Twenty-four hundred dollars,
if we don’t have to divide with some son of a
she-monkey!” and Coffin, grabbing his hat in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>right hand, pranced about the room and began on
the Harvard yell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinamen, shocked at the noise, and in imminent
fear of attracting attention to the illegal enterprise,
had grabbed him and stifled his fifth
“Rah!” when, suddenly, with a hoarse yelp, the
watchman at the look-out burst into the room, giving
the alarm for a raid of the police, and threw
two massive oaken bars across the iron door. In an
instant the tickets, pellets, and books were swept into
a sack, and the men scattered in all directions, sweeping
down tables and over chairs to escape arrest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Run for your life, or we’ll get pulled!” Coffin
called out to the Klondyker, who still held the ticket
in his hand, and he made a break for one of the
blue doors. It was slammed in his face by a retreating
scout. “Over here!” the Klondyker
cried, setting his foot to another door and forcing it
open. By this time the outer barrier at the entrance
from the restaurant had been forced, and the
police began with crowbars and sledge-hammers at
the inner door. Coffin ran for the exit, but stumbled
and fell across a chair, striking his diaphragm
with a shock that knocked the wind from his lungs.
For fully a minute he lay there writhing, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the power to move, gasping vainly for breath. The
blows on the door were redoubled in energy, and
of a sudden the wooden bars split and gave way,
the lock shot off into the room, the hinges broke
through the woodwork jambs, and the door toppled
and fell. It was now too late for the Freshman
to escape; a dozen men jumped into the room
and seized him with the few Chinamen left. To
his dazed surprise the attacking party was the very
same group of men he had taken for Eastern tourists
as he entered, now evidently plain-clothes detectives
who had been cunningly disguised to escape
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c000'>These, after their prisoners had been handcuffed,
ran here and there, dragging more refugees by their
queues in bunches from adjoining rooms and halls,
but most had made good their escape through the
many secret exits, hurrying, at the first warning, to
the roof, to underground passages in the cellar,
through the party walls to other buildings.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the last man had been secured, the crestfallen
captives were taken downstairs, loaded into
two patrol-wagons, and driven to the California
Street Station. The Klondyker was not among
their number.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>As the Freshman was searched and his hundred
dollars taken and sealed in an envelope with his
name, the booking-sergeant told him that if he
wished to deposit cash bail with the bond-clerk at
the City Hall he would be released. He might
send the money by a messenger, who would return
with his certificate of bail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much will it be?” Coffin asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One hundred, probably.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I can’t pay a messenger, for that’s exactly
all I have with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, well,” said the sergeant, looking at him
indulgently, “there’s an officer going up to the Hall
on an errand, and coming back pretty soon. I’ll
get him to take up your money, if you want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinamen were put into a cell together, and
Coffin was locked in a separate compartment containing
a single occupant, a weazened little man
with a chin beard, wearing a pepper-and-salt suit.
At the irruption of visitors, there arose from the
women’s cell an inhuman clamor, raised by two
wretched creatures. They shrieked like fiends of
the pit wailing in mockery at the spirits of the
damned. Coffin put his hands to his ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>His new companion regarded him with a watery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>blue eye. “All-fired nuisance, ain’t it? Gosh,
they yelp like seals at the Cliff House! I wish the
sergeant would turn the hose on ’em. I would.
They go off every twenty minutes, like a Connecticut
alarm-clock. Never mind, we’ll get out of this
soon. What were you pulled for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin narrated his adventures in Chinatown.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you’re all right, then, it’s just a periodical
spasm of virtue by the police. But I’m in for it.
They’re goin’ to sock it to me, by Jiminy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” Coffin asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little Yankee crept over to the Freshman’s
ear and whispered mysteriously, “Grand larceny!
They ain’t charged me with it yet, but they’re holdin’
me till they can collect evidence. And me a
reformed man. I’m a miserable sinner, but I’ve
repented, and I’ve paid back everything to the last
cent!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His confession, which was becoming per-fervent,
was here interrupted by a policeman who was looking
through the cells. “Hello, Eli,” he said, with
a sarcastic grin, “back again? I thought it was
about time!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say, what’s our little blue-eyed friend been up
to, officer?” the Freshman inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The man laughed. “Vagrancy, of course. Just
look at him. Ain’t he got the eye of a grafter? We
find him begging on the street every little while, but
he’ll get off with a reprimand. He always has plenty
of money on him. He’s nutty. Crazy as a hatter,
ain’t you, Eli?” He laughed again and passed on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you hear that?” cried the little man, angrily.
“He pretends I ain’t up for felony, but I am, though
they can’t prove it. It’s persecution, that’s what it
is. I don’t mind the fine for vagrancy, but I’m
afraid if I have to go to jail I’ll lose my car.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lose your car!” said Coffin, amused at the little
old man’s vagaries. “You don’t think a street-car
will wait for you while you’re bailed out, do you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mine will,” Eli replied. “That is, if it ain’t
stolen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stolen! Gee Whizz, you’re an Alice in Wonderland,
all right! Perhaps you will inform me
how they steal street-cars in San Francisco, and
how you happen to have one to be stolen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see you don’t believe it,” said the Yankee.
“But it’s as true as Gospel. I’ll tell you the whole
story and then you’ll think better of me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying, he fastened his watery blue eyes upon
the Freshman and gave him the history of his life.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE RETIRED CAR-CONDUCTOR</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I was born and brought up in Duxbury, Massachusetts,
and I had a close call to escape bein’
named Wrestling Brewster, one of my mother’s
family names. My father voted for just plain Eli
Cook, howsomever, and dad most always generally
won. It might have made considerable difference to
me, maybe, for as it was, whether from my name or
nature, I rather took after my father, who was no
mortal good. Father was what Old Colony folks
call “clever,” just a shif’less ne’er-do-well, handy
enough when he got to work, but a sort of a Jack-of-all-trades
and master of none. Never went to
church, fished on Sundays, smoked like a chimney
and chewed like a cow, easy to get on with and
hard to drive—no more backbone than a clam,
my mother used to say. And what he was, I am,
with just enough Brewster in me to make me repent,
but not enough to hinder me from going astray.</p>

<p class='c000'>I come out here to Californy in ’49, and hoofed it
most all the way. I calculated to get rich without
workin’, but I reckoned without my host. I looked
for somethin’ easy till I got as thin as a yaller dog,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and for twenty year I held on that way by my eyelids,
pickin’ up odd jobs and loafin’ and whittlin’
sticks in between times. Then I got a place as
driver on the Folsom Street hoss-car line, and that’s
where I made my fortune by hook or crook, till I
retired.</p>

<p class='c000'>If I’d had a drop more Brewster blood I wouldn’t
have did what I did, but I kind of fell into the way
of piecin’ out my salary the way every one else did
who worked for the company, and my conscience
didn’t give me no trouble for a considerable spell. It
was only stealin’ from a corporation, anyway, and
I reckoned they could afford it, with the scrimpin’
pay they give us.</p>

<p class='c000'>In them days the company ran them little double-ender
cars with ten-foot bodies. When I got to
the end of the route and drove my team round and
hitched up at t’other end, I had to take out the old
Slawson fare-box and set it up in front, for they
didn’t have no conductors in early days. I s’pose
I kind of hated to carry such a load of money, bein’
more or less of a shirk, and I got into the way of
turning her upside down and shakin’ out a few
nickels every time. They come out easy, I’ll say
that for ’em, and it wa’n’t no trick at all to clean up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>a dollar or so every day, and twice as much on
Sundays.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, so long as all the boys was a-doin’ the
same thing, the loss wa’n’t noticed, but somehow or
other the company got a few honest men on the
line, and they turned in so much more money than
we did every night that the old man smelled a
mouse. He put in the new Willis patent fare-box
that was durned hard to beat. It had a little three-cornered
wheel inside that acted like a valve, and
nothin’ that went in would come out, either by turnin’
the box upside down, or by usin’ the wire
pokers we experimented with. They wa’n’t nothin’
for it but to git keys, and so keys we got. It looked
a heap more like stealin’ than it did before, but it
was rather easier. Some of the boys was caught
at it, but as luck would have it, nobody never suspected
me, and I took out my little old percentage
regular as a faro dealer.</p>

<p class='c000'>I salted down my money in the Hibernia Bank,
and I called it my sinkin’ fund, which it was for sure
sinkin’ my soul down deeper and deeper into the
bottomless pit. I’m a-goin’ to make a clean breast of
it, howsomever, and I own up I was about as bad as
the rest of ’em, and four times as sharp at the game.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>After a while the system was improved, and the
company got new rollin’ stock with all two-horse
cars. I was a conductor then, and I ran on No. 27
till I was off the road. The Gardner punch was
my first experience in knockin’ down fares right in
the face and eyes of everybody, and I had figgered
a way to “hold out” long before I had the nerve to
try it. But Lord! it was as easy as fallin’ off a log,
when you knew how. You see, we sold a five-coupon
ticket for a quarter, and we had to slice off
a section for every fare, with a candle-snuffer arrangement,
the check droppin’ into a little box on the
under jaw of the nippers. All we had to do was
to “build up” on ’em. You held back a lot of
clipped tickets, with two or three or four coupons
left, as the case might be, and you kept ’em underneath
the bunch of regular tickets for sale. Say a
man handed you a whole ticket for two fares. You
made a bluff at cuttin’ it, and handed him back a
three-coupon ticket from underneath your rubber
band. You kept his whole one for yourself, and
sold it to the next passenger for two bits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, Jim Williams was caught red-handed, and
Gardner’s system went to Jericho. Next they
sprung the regular bell-punch on us, the kind you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“punch in the presence of the passenjaire.” We
had no trouble with that. They was a dummy
palm-bell manufactured almost simultaneous, and
we’d ring up fares without punchin’ at all. The
breastplate registers was worked similar, with a bell
inside your vest connected with a button. It was
as easy as pie, providin’ nobody watched the numbers
on the indicator while you was ringin’ up.</p>

<p class='c000'>I left the road before they adopted the stationary
registers or clock machines. I admit they’re ingenious,
but still I ain’t got no doubt that, given a
good big crowd and no spotters, I could manage to
make my expenses with the rest of the boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I won’t go round Robin Hood’s barn to spin
out the story. The result was that after about fifteen
years of patient, unremittin’ industry, I had
somethin’ like $12,000 in the bank, and what was
left of my New England conscience shootin’ through
me like rheumatism. It didn’t bother me so much
at first, but when once Brewster blood begins to boil
it don’t slow up in a hurry. Eli Cook didn’t seem
to care a continental, but they was a whole lot of
Pilgrim Fathers behind me that was bound to testify
sooner or later.</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to settle down and get into some quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>business, where I wouldn’t have no more trickery to
do than maybe put a little terra alba in the sugar and
peanuts in the coffee. But after lookin’ round I
hankered after makin’ money easier, and so I bought
minin’ stocks and hung on, assessment after assessment,
like grim Death, till, by Jimminy! one
day I’ll be durned if I didn’t calculate I had $30,000
to the good, if I sold. I pulled out the day before
the slump. I don’t know why Providence favored
my fortune, which was so wickedly come by,
and I don’t know why, after doin’ so well, I didn’t
have spunk enough to pay back the company, but,
anyhow, I wa’n’t yet waked up to feel full consciousness
of sin, and I shut my ears to the callin’ to repentance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, all this time, bein’ of a South Shore family
of seafaring men mostly, I had a hankerin’ after the
water. So, when the first lots was cut up, out to
the Beach, I bought a parcel of land on the shore.
I used to go out there all the time to sit on my own
sand, and recollect how it used to feel to get a good
dry heat on my bare legs when I was a boy down
to Duxbury. If they had only been clams there, I’d
have been as happy as a pollywog in a hogshead of
rain water.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>One day I was walkin’ out there, and as I passed
the company’s stables I see a sign out, “Cars for
Sale, Cheap,” and I went in to see ’em. I speered
round the yard till what did I see but old 27, my
car, settin’ there without wheels, lookin’ as shabby
as Job’s cat! I asked the foreman how much they
wanted for it, and I got it for ten dollars. I hired
a dray and moved the thing out to the Beach that
very afternoon. I set it up on two sills on my lot,
calculatin’ I could use it for a cabin to hang out in,
over Sunday, and it was as steady as Plymouth
Rock, and made as cute a little room as you’d
want to see. Every time I went I tinkered round
and fixed her up more, till I had a good bunk at
one end, lockers under the seats, and a trig little
cellar beneath, where I kept canned stuff.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Twa’n’t long before I regularly moved out there
and stayed for good. Just from force of habit, I
expect, at first, I rung two bells every time I got on,
and one bell before I got off, and I always keep it
up, just as if the old car was really on the rails. I
never went in and set down but I felt as if No. 27
was poundin’ along toward Woodward’s Gardens,
with the hosses on a jog trot. Sometimes when the
rain was drivin’ down and the wind blowin’ like all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>possessed, and it was pitch dark outside, with the
surf rollin’, I’d put down my pipe and go out on the
platform, and set the brake up just as tight as I
could. I don’t know why, but it kind of give me a
sense of security.</p>

<p class='c000'>It wa’n’t long before I begun to feel a positive
affection for that old car, what with the years I’d
spent on it, and livin’ ’way out there to the Beach
alone with nothin’ to think about but the way I’d
robbed the company. No. 27 was more like a pet
dog than a house. You can talk about ships bein’
like women, and havin’ queer ways and moods, but
you go to work and take an old car, and it’s more
like folks than a second cousin; and it’s got sense
and temper, I’m persuaded of that.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it wa’n’t long before No. 27 begun to act
queer. I noticed it a considerable spell before I
realized just what was wrong. It wouldn’t stay still
a minute. It groaned and sighed like a sinner on
the anxious seat. I couldn’t ease it any way I tried.
It worked off the sills, and just wallowed in the
sand. The sand drifts like snow at the Beach, and
often I used to have to dig myself out the door after
a sou’wester. I didn’t mind bein’ alone so much,
for I had a book of my Uncle Joshua Cook’s sermons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to read, but the way that old car talked to
itself got on my nerves. The windows rattled, and
sometimes a shutter would fall with a bang, sudden,
and I’d jump half out of my skin. Then, too, that
stealin’ was preyin’ on my mind, and I couldn’t help
harpin’ on it. They was a Slawson fare-box still
on the front of the car, and finally I got to goin’ in
t’other way to avoid it. Then the green light got
to watchin’ me, and I begun to drink, for I felt the
full qualms of the unrighteous, and the car itself
seemed to know it was defiled by my sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, one night, I come home from the Cliff
House, where I’d been warmin’ up my courage,
and when I got back to No. 27 I see the green
lantern I’d left lit was a burnin’ low, almost out. I
got up on the platform and tried to ring two bells
as usual, but the cord broke in my hands. I tried
the door, but it wouldn’t budge. That blamed
car just naturally refused to recognize me, and
wouldn’t let me in. Then I sat down in the sand
and cried like a fool, and wondered what was
wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>It bust on me like a light from the sky, and the
callin’ of a sinner to repentance, sayin’, “Come
now, this is the appointed time.” All I’d done in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the old days rose up in front of me, and right there
I experienced a change of heart and was convicted
of sin. It come sudden, and I acted sudden. I
didn’t stop to think nor reason, nor to set my
mortal mind against the judgment of Heaven and
that car, but I rose up confident of grace, and
went round to the front platform where the fare-box
was, and dropped in a nickel and tried the
bell. The cord wa’n’t broke on this side, and
she rung all right. The light flared up again, and
the door opened as easy as a snuff-box. I was
saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that time on I never got aboard without
payin’ my fare, and when the box was full I’d
turn it over to the treasurer of the company. Of
course I might have drawn out my money in the
bank and paid it all up at once, but it seemed to
me that this means was shown me, so that I would
be reminded of my wickedness every day and keep
in the road of repentance. But even then, sometimes
I backslid and fell from grace when I
emptied out the box. Some of the money would
stick to my fingers, and it seemed as if I couldn’t
stop stealin’ from the company. But afterward
I’d repent and put in a quarter or even a half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>dollar for my fare to make up, and in that way I
went on tryin’ to lead a better life, and keep in the
straight and narrer road of salvation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I thought then that No. 27 would settle
down and give me some peace of mind, but it
wa’n’t long before that car begun to get uneasy
again. I didn’t know what in creation to make of
it, and it beat all the way it took on. I drew out
$5,000 of good securities that was payin’ nine per
cent. and sent it all in gold coin packed in a barrel
of barley to the company, but that didn’t do no
good at all. The car was plum crazy, and nothin’
seemed to satisfy the critter.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 27 settled and sobbed and sighed like a
fellow that’s been jilted by a flirt. They wa’n’t
no doin’ nothin’ with it. I puttered over it and
tightened all the nuts, but it snivelled and whined
like a sick pup every time the wind blew. When
the fog come in, the drops of water stood on the
window panes like tears, and every gale made the
body tremble like a girl bein’ vaccinated. The
old car must be sick, I thought, and I greased all
the slides and hinges with cod-liver oil. The thing
only wheezed worse than ever. I thought likely it
might be just fleas, for the sand is full of ’em, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>I sponged the cushions with benzine. It wa’n’t no
more use than nothin’ at all!</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps I ain’t got no call to boast, but I flatter
myself I found out what was lackin’ as soon as
most would have done. Howsomever, I spent a
good deal of time walkin’ round the Beach thinkin’
it over. They’s quite a colony of us out there now;
seemed like my car drew out a lot of others, until
they’s more than a baker’s dozen of ’em scattered
around, built up and managed in different ways,
accordin’ to the ideas of their owners. Some h’ist
’em up and build a house underneath, some put
two alongside and rip out the walls, some put ’em
end to end, some make chambers of ’em and some
settin’-rooms. They call the colony Carville-by-the-Sea,
and it looks for all the world like some
new-fangled sort of Chinatown.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was walkin’ round one day, inspectin’ the new
additions to the place, when I see a car I thought
I recognised. I went up, and if it wa’n’t a Fifth
Street body, and as far as I could see, it must have
been the very one old 27 used to transfer with in
the old days! It was numbered 18, and I remembered
how she used to wait for us on the
corner when we was late. Then I understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>what was the matter with my car. It was just
naturally pinin’ away for its old mate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, sir, I went to the owner and bought No.
18 at his own price. I’d have paid twenty-five
dollars if he’d asked it. I moved her onto my lot,
put a foundation under her, sideways to 27, like
an ell to a farm-house. And it seemed to me I
noticed old 27 give a grunt and settle down in
peace and contentment. I was a good guesser. I
hitched ’em together with a little stoop, covered
over so as to make the two practically one, and
then I give the whole thing a fresh coat of white
paint, and cleaned up the windows and swept out
till it was all spick and span. And I never had
no trouble with No. 27 after that, nor with my
own conscience neither, for now the money’s all
paid back with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, sir, maybe you won’t believe it, and maybe
you will, but about a year after the two was hitched
together a funny thing happened. One day morning
I went outdoors, and see something on the sand
beside No. 18. My eyes stuck out like a fifer’s
thumb when I recognised what it was. It was a
plum new red wheelbarrow!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE EX-MEDIUM’S ADVENTURE: THE INVOLUNTARY SUICIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Warmed by his copious draughts of wine,
stimulated by the comradeship of his fellow-adventurers,
and his stomach packed
to the top corner with rich foods, Professor Vango
left Coffee John’s, rejoicing in a brave disregard for
the troubles that had been for so long pursuing
him. His superstitious terrors had subsided, and
for a while he was a man again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clay Street was empty, and stretched black and
narrow to the water-front. Below him lay the
wholesale commercial quarter of the town with its
blocks of deserted warehouses, silent and dark. It
was a part of San Francisco almost unknown to
the ex-medium, and now, at midnight, obscure and
bewildering, a place of possibilities. He was for
adventures, and he decided to seek them in the
inscrutable region of the docks.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stepped boldly down the street, but it was
not long before the echoes of his footsteps struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>him chill with dread. The packing-cases upon the
curb cast shadows where fearsome things might
lurk. He began to watch with a roving eye the
crossings and alleys, from which some form might
come upon him unawares, and he cast sharp glances
over his shoulder for the appearance of the spirit
that had cowed him. The thought of Mrs. Higgins
brought him back to his old torture. He felt
as though she were always round the next corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had almost reached East Street, when he
yielded to his qualms and bolted into the warmth
and light of the Bowsprit Saloon to drown his forebodings
in two schooners of steam beer. So disappeared
Coffee John’s luck-dime, and with it the
stimulating effects of his exordium. Vango’s short
glow of comfort was, however, but a respite, for
shortly after midnight the bar closed, and he was
sent forth again into the perilous night.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was pacing up and down the stone arcade
of the Ferry Building, dismally anticipating the prospect
of walking the city streets alone with his curse,
when it occurred to him that he might possibly
make his way to Oakland. Oakland was less
strenuous; it was calm, sober, respectable, free
from the distressing torments of San Francisco.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Many a time he had met Mrs. Higgins upon the
dock behind the waiting-room, and he knew the
way well. He dodged slyly up the wagon-track,
round the corner of the baggage-room, to the slip
where the steamer Piedmont was waiting to set out
on her last trip. As he came to the apron a few
belated commuters were running for the boat. He
joined them without being observed, and was hurried
aboard by a warning from the deck-hands.
Just as he reached the bib the bridge was drawn
up, the hawsers cast off, and with a deep roaring
whistle the vessel started, gathered way, and, urged
by the jingle-bell, shot out of the slip into the waters
of the Bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crowds went forward, upstairs, to the protection
of the cabin, but Professor Vango stayed by
the after-rail alone, where a chain was stretched
across the open stern. A ragged mist lay upon the
harbour, hanging to the surface of the water like a
blanket, torn open sometimes by a passing gust of
wind and closing up to a thicker fog beyond.
High in the air, it was clearer, and the stars shone
bright.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thumping paddle-wheels, the phosphorescent
waves, and the fey obscurity of the night wrought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>heavily upon Vango’s emotion, and the fumes of
alcohol mingled in his brain. He was not happy;
things went round a bit, and he had hard work
controlling his thoughts. He longed for the gay
cheerfulness of the saloon above, but he felt a need
of the sharp night air to revive him, first. He
watched the stairway suspiciously, feeling sure that
the ghost of Mrs. Higgins, if she were to appear,
would come that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>In point of fact, a woman did soon descend from
the upper deck, and stood at the bottom of the
stairs in some uncertainty, gazing about her. She
was a heavy, middle-aged blonde, in a long black
cape and veil, the type of a thousand weak, impressionable
widows, and, in the dusk, through the
glaze of Vango’s eyes, a passable counterfeit of the
late lamented Mrs. Higgins. She soon perceived
him, and came forward a few steps, while he retreated
as far away, putting her off with futile gestures.
Curious at this exhibition, the woman walked
up to him with a question on her lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was, in all probability, in search of nothing
more than a glass of water, but the medium had
no more than time to hear, “Tell me where—”
before he had mentally completed the inquiry for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>her. “Where—where is Lilian?” she meant, of
course. Appalled, he had jumped over the chain
in the stern, and as she approached with that
demand piercing his conscience-stricken soul, he
shrank back unconsciously. The first step carried
him to the extreme end of the boat, the second led
him, with a splashing fall, into the Bay. The
waters closed over him, and the steamer swept on.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came to the surface, spluttering but
sober at last in the face of a new and more tangible
danger, he heard the rising staccato of a
woman’s shriek, and saw a pyramid of lights fading
into the fog. Then he sank again, and all was
cold, black, and wet.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>He rose to the surface in a space clear of mist,
dimly lighted by a wisp of moon. A few feet
away a fruit-crate bobbed upon the waves in the
steamer’s wake, and for this he swam. By placing
it under his body, he found he could float well
enough to keep his nose out of water, tolerably
secure from drowning, for a time at least.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mist closed in upon him, was swept asunder,
and shut down again. The current was bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>him toward the harbour entrance he decided, and,
as he had fallen overboard about opposite Goat
Island, he must by this time be in the fairway, drifting
for the Golden Gate and the Pacific. He
might, if his endurance held out, catch sight of some
ship anchored in the stream, and hail her crew.
But no lights appeared, and he grew deathly cold
and stiff.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Professor Vango’s ears the sobbing of the
siren on Lime Point was lulling him to a sleep
that promised eternal forgetfulness, and the Alcatraz
Island bell was tolling grewsomely of his passing,
when his senses were aroused by a brisker
note that came in quick, padded beats through the
fog. He summoned his drowsy wits for a last
effort, and gazed into the gloom. Suddenly, piercing
the cloudy curtain drawn about him, came a
small launch, stern on, churning its way at full
speed straight at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In another moment it would have sped past him,
to be swallowed up in the darkness again, but,
with a mighty struggle, he threw himself at the
boat, and, dodging the whirling propeller, clutched
the rail with a violence that made the craft careen.
It dipped as if to throw him off, but Vango held on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>and screamed hoarsely for help. No reply came
from the boat, nor was anybody to be seen in it,
so at last he made shift to climb aboard and reach
the cock-pit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vapour and darkness lay about him like a
pall, muffling even the outlines of the boat itself;
no lights were burning aboard. Shivering, perplexed,
terrified, but grateful for his preservation,
and wondering where his fate had led him, the Professor
started on a further examination of the launch.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had taken but a few steps, when his foot
struck a soft something extended upon the floor.
His teeth chattered with fear as he groped down
and made it out to be a human form. That it was
a woman, he discovered by the long hair that had
overflowed her shoulders in crisp waves, and a
touch of her body showed that she was alive. He
lifted her to a sitting posture on the seat, then
loosened her dress at the neck, and chafed her
wrists and temples. Her breath soon came in
gasps; she sighed heavily and sat erect, with a
shudder. She gazed into his face in the dimness,
then cast her eyes over the boat and fell to weeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, for some time, the launch, carrying its two
wretched passengers, and what more Vango dared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>not guess, plunged on insanely through the fog.
The medium knew nothing of practical affairs;
psychology was his art, and chicanery his science;
but even had he been mechanic enough to stop and
reverse the engine in the dark, it would have taken
a considerable acquaintance with the Bay of San
Francisco to have set and kept any logical course
in such a night. Wrapped in a tarpaulin which
he found by him, under which his dripping form
shivered in misery, the unhappy man sat, baffled,
mystified, hopeless, too beat about in his mind even
to wonder. The woman cried on and the propeller
kept up its rhythmic thud, thud, thud, dragging
the little vessel where it would.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the swing of the choppy sea flung the
woman at full length across the seat and brought
her to her senses. She arose, now, and scanned
the fog, then peered curiously at the medium, who
was silent from very terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are we? Where, in Heaven’s name,
did you come from?” she cried, sharply, and she
approached him with a searching gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trickster that he was, he sought some wile to
outwit her. He mumbled something about having
fallen off Fishermen’s Wharf.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>She stumbled to the cuddy under the seat and
brought out a lantern and a box of matches. With
these she obtained a light and held it flaring in
Vango’s face. “I don’t know who you are,” she
said, “but you’ve got to help me get this boat back.
Are you armed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The medium made an emphatic denial, for the
woman’s face was sternly set. She was indubitably
a quadroon, by evidence of her creamy,
swarthy skin and the tight curls of her hair. Her
dark eyes burned in the lamplight under heavy,
knotted brows, her full lips drawing apart like a
dog’s to show a line of white, straight teeth. She
was the picture of Judith ready to strike, and
Vango trembled under her gaze till she turned from
him with an expression of contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come aft and help me with the machinery,”
she commanded. “We can’t keep on, Heaven
knows where, at full speed backward through
weather like this. Fi-fi, now, and mind your feet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went to the tiny engine where, fumbling
with the levers and stop-cocks, she brought the
machinery to a stop. The silence crowded down
upon them, as if someone had just died. Vango
noticed that the woman kept between him and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>starboard rail with some secret intent, and, as the
two eyed each other, he caught sight of a revolver
swinging from her belt. He saw something else,
also, that made his heart stop beating for an instant;
and then the quadroon held up her hand and listened
attentively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you hear a bell?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely had she spoken when in the distance a
fog-whistle sang out across the water, and through
the flying scud a yellow light winked and went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re right off Alcatraz,” she said. “Here,
you stand by this lever and mind my orders.
Watch now, how I do it. Way forward for full
speed ahead, way back to reverse, and midway to
stop; and turn off the naphtha at this throttle. I’ll
take the wheel, and we’ll make across for the Lombard
Street Wharf. Keep a look-out ahead, and
let me know the instant you see a light, or anything!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went forward to the wheel, and the launch
forged ahead at half-speed with Vango shuddering
at the engine. But it was not only the piercing
wind that froze him stiff as he stood, for there was
a ghastly horror aboard that was almost unbearable.
As the woman had stood by the engine, swinging
her lantern to show the working of the machinery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the light had sought out one corner after another,
and, though she had stood between, the rays fell
once upon an object protruding from beneath the
seat. It was a foot; there was no mistaking the
outline, though the light had touched it but for an
instant. With all his resolution he put the sight out
of his mind and said no word to her, for her eyes
terrified him, and he dared not question.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had, however, left the lantern behind to illuminate
the machine, and it now slanted past and
flickered on the toe of that foot. He tried to remove
his eyes from it, but the thing held him with
a morbid fascination. Look where he would, it
stuck in the end of his eye and held him in an
anguish. He kept his hand ready to the lever, and
succeeded in obeying the woman’s orders to stop,
go ahead, or back, but he acted as one hypnotised.</p>

<p class='c000'>In about half an hour a dim light off the bow
warned them off Lombard Street pier, and from
here they crawled slowly past the water-front, guided
by the lights on the sea-wall and the lanterns of
ships in the stream. Below the Pacific Mail dock
their run was straight for Mission Rock, and from
there to the Potrero flats, but they were continually
getting off their course and regaining it, beating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>about this way and that, confused in direction by
the lights in the fog.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time the two exchanged hardly a
word that did not have to do with the navigation
of the boat. Vango watched her, silhouetted
against the mist as she bent to one side and the
other, and the distressing tensity of the situation did
not prevent him now from racking his wits to find
some possible explanation of her identity and purpose.
He was a keen observer and used to making
shrewd guesses, but this was too much for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last, in the gray of the dawn, the launch
arrived off Hunter’s Point, and the medium’s eyes
were straining through the murk to see some landing
pier, when he received a sudden summons to
stop the boat. He obeyed and looked up at the
woman, who came aft. He flattened himself
against the rail in terror of her, for, sure now that
one murder had been done aboard the launch, he
feared another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” said the quadroon woman, “I want to
know who you are and all about you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few stuttering syllables he told her his story,
persisting with a childish fatuity in the deceit he
had already begun, and welding to it bits of truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>from the strange procession of events that had
carried him through the past few months. When
he mentioned the fact that he was a medium, he
noticed a change in the woman’s attitude immediately.
His cunning awoke, and the sharper began
to assert himself, following this clew, telling of
how many persons he had aided with his wonderful
clairvoyant powers, and the success of his trances.
It is needless to say that he did not mention Mrs.
Higgins, nor his reason for having given up his practice.
As he rolled off the glib catch-words and
phrases of his trade, he watched the woman sharply
through his drooping eyelids with the agile scrutiny
of a professional trickster, and sought in her appearance
some clew to her secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>With all her determination, the woman was undoubtedly
sadly distraught. The pistol by her side
hinted at violence. Her dishevelled hair, the distraction
of her garments, her clinched fists and
tightened brows told clearly of some moving experience.
Above all, the corpse beside the engine,
and her attempts to hide it, proclaimed some secret
tragedy. Yet while her mouth trembled her eyes
were steady; if he made a wrong guess it might
not be well for him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>At the end of his explanations she had melted in
a burst of feminine credulity and hunger for the
marvellous. “Then you can help me,” she exclaimed,
throwing herself upon his leadership in a
swift submission to the dominant sex. “You <em>must</em>
help me! I am in great trouble, and what is to be
done must be done quickly. Can you hold a sitting
now? I want to find something as soon as I can—it
is of the greatest importance—I would give any
price to know where to find it. You must get your
spirit friends to help me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The medium shuffled. “You’re rather nervous,
and the conditions ain’t favourable when a party is
excited or sufferin’ from excitin’ emotions. The
proper degree of mutuality ain’t to be obtained unless
a sitter is what you might call undisturbed.”
Then he put all his shrewdness into a piercing gaze.
“Besides, you got murder on you! I see a red
aura hoverin’ over you like you had bloody hands!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this the quadroon burst out, “I haven’t, but
I wish I had, and it isn’t my fault!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Confession is good for the soul of a party,”
Vango said, with unction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll tell you everything, if you’ll only promise to
help me. I am innocent of any real crime, I swear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>before God! But I tried to kill a man to-night. It
was in self-defence, though.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took the lantern, and, setting the light on the
seat, pointed silently to the body. “Look at him!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a heroic conflict with his repugnance the
medium rolled the corpse over till it lay face up.
The dead man was a Chinaman. He could see
that by his clothes and hair, although his face was
half masked with clotted blood. Two shocking
gashes in the forehead turned Vango sick with
horror. He looked up at the woman with fear in
his eyes, and asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who was the deceased?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was my husband,” she said, and her sobs
choked her. “We must get him ashore and put
him in the house, and then we can decide what
next, and perhaps you can help me. There’s our
pier, over there,” and she pointed out the light on a
little wharf running out from the gloom. She took
the wheel again, and the launch was docked at the
pier.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Vango disembarked and prepared to help
her with the corpse, the quadroon woman quickly
stopped him. “Here,” she said, pointing to a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>wooden case in the bow, “this must go ashore first.
Take it into the shed there and watch out that you’re
not seen. It won’t do for the police to see it, or
any of the neighbours. I’d rather they saw the
body!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stooped and untied a coil of rope from the
case, and then the two lifted it to the floating stage.
It weighed something over a hundred pounds, and
it was all they could do to carry it together up the
steep incline and along the pier to the shed. The
woman took a key from her pocket, and unlocked
the door. When the case was inside the room,
which was scantily furnished with a few chairs and
tables, they returned to the launch.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they approached the stage, Vango thought
of the woman’s request for a seance, and her words
struck him as curious. He asked her carelessly
what it was she wished to find.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A scrap of red paper, with Chinese writing on
it,” was the reply. She had no more than uttered
the words, when, glancing over at the launch,
Vango saw on the floor in the rays of the lantern
a red spot. Looking more closely, he saw that it
was undoubtedly the very paper the woman wanted.
He turned suddenly and faced her to prevent her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>seeing it, and seized her hand. Then he sighed
heavily, passing his free hand over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel a vibration of a self-independent message
from my control,” he said, and fetched a dramatic
shudder. “They is a kind of a pain in my
head, as though a party had passed out of a stab
like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This revelation was made in a die-away voice, as
if from many miles off, and he glanced through a slit
in his lids at the quadroon to see how she was taking
it. Then he shuddered again more violently, but
this time without dissimulation. His hand gripped
hers like a wrestler’s, his eyes leaped past her, over
her shoulder, staring; for there, dimly shadowed in
the obscurity, holding up a spectral arm in warning,
was Mrs. Higgins!</p>

<p class='c000'>Vango’s soul was torn between greed and fear.
Here was another dupe who could restore his fortune,
the way to cajole her plain before him—there
was the threatening form of his Nemesis protesting
against his roguery, and he faltered in dread.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, what is it, what is it?” the quadroon woman
cried, piteously.</p>

<p class='c000'>The medium’s cupidity won, and the credulous
woman in the flesh was more potent than her sister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in the spirit. He shut his eyes and went desperately
on:</p>

<p class='c000'>“She gives me this message: What you’re
a-lookin’ for will be found sooner than what you
expect, and you’ll come by it on the water. You’ll
be guided to it by a party who is a good friend to
you and you can trust, and she gives me the letter
’V.’ He’s a dark-complected man with a beard,
and there’ll be money a-comin’ to him through your
help.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having trembled again, and sighed himself back
to life, the medium turned to her drowsily, as if he
had just been called from bed. “Where am I?”
he said, in mock surprise, and then with a groan of
relief, as he saw that Mrs. Higgins had disappeared,
he added, “Oh, what was I sayin’? I must have
went into a trance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The quadroon was in a high tremor of suspense.
“What is your name? You never told me,” she
demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My name?” he repeated, with a baby stare.
“Vango, Professor Vango. Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you’re the man,” she cried. “Come!
Help me take the body ashore, for we must get him
to Chinatown as quickly as the Lord will let us.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>He waited till she had jumped into the boat and
had laid her hand to the corpse, and then he snatched
for the paper and waved it in the air. “Did you
say it was a scrap of red paper you lost?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She sprang at him and looked closely. “This is
the very piece I wanted! Wong Yet is one of
them!” she cried. “Now my poor husband can
be avenged! God bless you, Professor; you have
proved your part of the message is true, and I reckon
I’ll prove mine. Find the other half of this piece
of paper for me, you can do it easy with your spirit
guides, and I’ll give you a thousand dollars for it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They stooped over the dead Chinaman, and,
with Professor Vango at the shoulders and the
quadroon at the knees, the corpse was carried up
the landing stage and along the pier to the shed.
Here was hitched a pitifully dirty white horse harnessed
to a disreputable covered laundry-wagon,
spattered with adobe mud. Into this equipage they
loaded the remains, piled the case in the rear, and
buttoned down the curtains. Then the woman
mounted with Vango to the seat and drove for the
Potrero.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they turned into the San Bruno Road, the
quadroon began her promised confession. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>could not proceed calmly, but was swept with alternate
passions of sorrow and rage. The medium,
however, unmoved by her suffering, eyed her craftily,
watching his chance to feed upon her superstitious
hopes.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE QUADROON WOMAN</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I reckon you don’t guess a coloured person
can hate white folks as much as white folks
hate niggers, but they do, sometimes, and I
despise a white man more than if I were a sure-enough
black woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>My Daddy was born fairer than a good many
white trash. Some folks never knew he was a
mulatto. My ma died when I was born. Daddy
wanted me to be educated, so I was sent to the
Tuskegee Institute, where I learned nursing. After
that we lived a little way out of Mobile, and we
were right happy for a good while.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, about two years back, there was an awful
crime committed near our place, and all the whites
went pretty near crazy. You don’t have to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>told what it was, and you know what law amounts
to at such times. Any coloured man that is once
suspected has no show at all. Daddy was innocent,
of course, but if he’d been guilty, I’d have stood
up for him just the same. He was put in jail, and
they got up a mob to lynch him. I got wind of it
just in time. There was a sheriff’s deputy who
was fond of me, and he and I managed to get
Daddy out and started West.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had no idea just where Daddy had gone, till
one day I was looking over the Mobile <cite>Register</cite>,
and I come on a “Personal” that made me prick
up my ears. It looked like it might have been
written by my Daddy for me to see. It was addressed
“Aber,” and when I turned the word
backward, the way you do sometimes with funny-sounding
words, I saw it made my own name,
“Reba.” It read like this:</p>

<p class='c014'>Aber: Shall answer no further requests, as nobody can
identify. Sheriff called off.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Odod.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now Odod was just Dodo backward; that was
my pet name for Daddy when I was little. The
word “sheriff” seemed likely, but I couldn’t understand
that about “requests.” Then I thought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>read the first letters of each word, like the acrostics
Daddy and I used to work out together in the
<cite>Youth’s Companion</cite>, and there it was, easy. Just
“San Francisco.” Then I knew Daddy was safe
in California and wanted me to come on.</p>

<p class='c000'>I packed right up and bought a ticket, hoping to
find him somehow when I got there. I didn’t think
anybody would suspicion my leaving, but I had no
idea how cruel white folks can be, till I had gone
too far to come back. Just after we left New Orleans
I thought I saw a man following me. I wasn’t
quite certain till we changed cars at El Paso, but
then I knew he was a sure-enough detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>Talk about bloodhounds! That man never left
me out of his sight for a minute. He sat in the
corner with his hat pulled over his face, and I could
just feel his eyes boring a hole in my back.</p>

<p class='c000'>First thing I did after I got to the Golden West
Hotel was to mail a personal to the <cite>Herald</cite>. It
read like this:</p>

<p class='c014'>Odod: Any money will assist the cause. Help earnestly
desired. We are in trouble.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Aber.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I knew if he saw this message he’d see it meant
“Am watched. Wait.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Well, I can’t tell you half what I went through
that first week, with the detective turning up everywhere
I went, till I was afeared I’d die of the strain.
Sometimes I just felt like murdering him to get him
out of the way. I didn’t care so much for myself,
but I was in mortal terror lest he’d catch sight of
Daddy and arrest him. I watched my chance, and
one night I went to bed early, leaving word at the
office to be called at five next morning. Then, at
two o’clock I got up and went out, leaving all my
things in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took a room down on Third Street, near Minna,
and for three weeks I was mighty careful where I
went, waiting for the deputy to leave town. I got
a few jobs of nursing, so I paid my way for a spell;
then I just couldn’t stand it a day more, and I risked
getting word to Daddy. So I put another personal
in the paper, telling him, the same way as before,
to meet me at the old Globe Hotel in Chinatown
next night. You know the old Globe used to be
right smart of a hotel in early days, but now there
are hundreds of Chinamen living in it. It’s like
an ant-hill, full of all sorts of ways and corners to
get out.</p>

<p class='c000'>I waited on the steps, keeping a sharp eye out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>for Daddy. But I hadn’t been there more than
ten minutes before I saw—not my dear old Dodo—but
the detective who had followed me all the way
West. I ran down the steps and walked up Dupont
Street as fast as I dared, never looking round
once nor letting on I had seen him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got to the corner of Washington Street,
only a matter of a block away, I ran smack into a
man. He grabbed me in his arms, and was crying
over me before I recognised him by his voice as
Daddy, for he had a light wig and a dyed mustache,
and wore blue spectacles. I had no time to kiss
him even. I just whispered to him, “The detective—run
for your life!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Daddy gave one glance over his shoulder, and
ran up Washington Street. The detective saw him
go, and dashed after him, and I followed them both.
They turned up a flight of steps into a big doorway,
a little piece up the block.</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw by the sign over the door that it was a
Chinese theatre they had gone into.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I just had to find out what was going on inside,
so I paid the man at the door fifty cents and
went up the stairs. I had never been in such a
place before, of course, and at first I had no idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>what to do or where to go. There was no sign
of Daddy or the detective anywhere, and the place
was filled with a great crowd of Chinamen on the
seats. The only white people I saw were a lady
and two men sitting up on one side of the open
stage. I was bewildered and frightened to death,
for there was a horrible noise of big gongs and
squeaking fiddles, and actors in queer costumes
singing and talking in shrill voices.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Chinaman came down the crowded aisle and
took me up to a seat beside the tourists on the
stage, and there I had to sit in front of that crowd
of coolies while the play went on and on and on.
I have seen Chinese plays enough since, but then it
was all new and terrible, for the orchestra was right
near me, making such a noise that I thought I’d go
mad, and the actors kept coming in and going out
past me reciting in a sing-song. I wanted to scream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away up over the stage was a break in the wall
where the ceiling went up higher, and there was a
little window almost above my head. There, once
I saw a head stuck out and a Chinaman looked at
me, long and hard. This made me more frightened
than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just when I thought I couldn’t stand it a minute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>longer, I heard the voice of a white man swearing
in the dressing-room behind the stage, and then the
detective came through the curtain looking like he
was mad enough to kill somebody. Frightened as
I was at him, my heart was nigh ready to break
with joy, for I knew that Daddy must have escaped
from him somehow. He looked over the audience
from the floor to the galleries where the women
were, and finally went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he was out of sight a Chinaman came
up to me and grinned. “You likee see actor dlessing-loom?”
he said. Something told me that he
was a friend and I got right up and followed him.
We went into the dressing-room, where all the costumes
were hung on the wall and the actors were
putting on queer dresses and painting their faces,
then up a flight of stairs. I kept my eyes open
sharp, looking everywhere for Daddy. Above the
stage was the joss-house room of the theatre with
punks burning, but the place was empty. Above
that was the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then we turned a corner, went down some
steps and came to a padlocked door. My guide
unlocked it, put me outside on a platform, whistled
and left me, after saying, “You keep still; bimeby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>you catch him!” Then I heard his footsteps going
back into the building.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was alone on an outside balcony, looking down
into a dark alley, three floors below.</p>

<p class='c000'>After awhile a door opened, and a man beckoned
to me. We went through a little hall with
doors on each side and dark passages leading off
every which way, and down these, in and out till
I was more confused than ever, and then finally he
knocked at a little door. It was opened, and I was
pushed inside.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a tiny box of a room, low and narrow.
On a broad bunk at one side, two Chinese actors
in costumes were lying, smoking opium pipes.
Leastways, I thought they were Chinamen, but as
soon as the door was shut, one jumped up and took
me in his arms. I screamed and fought to get away,
but he called me Reba, and I knew it was Daddy.
No wonder I didn’t recognise him before. He had
on a wig with a long queue, and a gold embroidered
costume, and his face was painted in a
hideous fashion, with his nose all white and streaks
under his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I had kissed half the paint off his face he
told me what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Daddy had been in San Francisco long enough to
get pretty well acquainted with Chinatown. He had
kept around there from the first, to escape notice,
and he had got to be mighty good friends with one
of the actors who spoke English fairly well. When
he was chased by the detective he had made straight
for Moy Kip’s room, and asked to hide out. The
Chinese are used to fooling the police, and Kip just
threw a gown over Daddy’s shoulders, painted his
face, and put him on the opium bunk. When the
officer went through the actors’ rooms, he looked in,
but didn’t see any more than I saw at first. Then
Moy Kip watched me through the little window
over the stage, and as soon as the detective left the
place they sent for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Daddy and I were taken to a room three stories
under the sidewalk, where we hid for a week, going
upstairs at meal-times. It was just like one big
family of about eighty men, but only one or two
women. The little rooms we had were dark and
dirty and close, and the smell was something awful.
I couldn’t have stood it alone, but Daddy was safe.
That was enough for a while.</p>

<p class='c000'>But living Chinese fashion, without sunlight or
decent food, didn’t agree with Daddy at all, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>fell sick. It wasn’t only the air that was ailing him,
it was the fear of capture, too, and with all the hardship
and worry his fever got steadily worse. A
Chinese doctor in big spectacles and a long white
mustache came in to see him, and mixed him up
some black, horrid, smelly stuff, made of sea-horses
and lizards, and Moy Kip burned punks in the joss-house
upstairs, but he didn’t get any better. He
was always worrying about something when he was
delirious, and I couldn’t make out quite what it was
about till one day, just before the end, when his
mind cleared and he told me. Moy Kip wanted to
marry me! Daddy didn’t know what to do. He
couldn’t bear to ask me to marry a Chinaman,
and he didn’t like to refuse the man who had been
right kind to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>You can imagine how I felt about it. It would
have been bad enough if Moy Kip had been an
ordinary Chinaman, but, being an actor, he belonged
to almost the lowest caste. Undertakers and barbers
and boatmen are the only ones below. Actors
can’t even mix equally with ordinary coolies. Besides,
Kip being the principal “white-face” actor
or comedian, the manager didn’t let him leave the
theatre much, for fear he’d be kidnapped by highbinders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and held for ransom. If I married him,
the life would be something awful.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now, to make it all worse, my poor old
Dodo was taken away. He died in my arms after
being sick a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was alone in the city, without money or friends,
except the Chinese actors. I was almost crazy for
sunlight and fresh air, and the sight of decent people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moy Kip was the only one of the crowd of
Chinamen in the building who could speak English
very well, and he had also been my father’s friend.
He was educated after a fashion, and, for a Chinaman,
kind and gentlemanly.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, soon after Daddy was buried, Kip
came to my room. I was crying on the bunk, and
he stood there watching me; then he placed a roll
of gold on the table. “I give you two hundled
dollar,” he said. “You likee go away home? No
good stay here. Chiny actor heap bad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I sat up in surprise. I wondered where I would
ever find another man who, loving me and having
me in his power, would give me the means to escape.
Right away I began to like him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Moy Kip,” I said, “you have been so
good to poor Daddy!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>He looked at me hard, and said, “You likee
Moy Kip? You mally me, please?”</p>

<p class='c000'>So, after a while, I ended by accepting him, and
I have never been sorry since. We were married
in the Chinese way. I wore a stiff dress of red
silk my husband bought for me, and my hair was
braided tight and greased, fastened with gold fila-gree
and jade ornaments. I had my cheeks rouged
and eyebrows painted, and all.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not till the carriage took me from my
old rooms and the slave woman had carried me on
her back up the stairs and into Moy Kip’s home
(so that I should not stumble on the threshold and
bring bad luck), that I found out how much difference
the marriage was going to make to my husband.
For I wasn’t taken to the theatre at all, but
to a little set of rooms in Spofford Alley. When
he came in to meet me, dressed like a prince in his
lilac blouse and green trousers, I asked him how it
happened he hadn’t fitted up a room for me in the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seems like he reckoned I had brought him luck,
for he had paid the manager for the right to quit
acting, and he was going to try and get into more
respectable business. In China, of course, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>have had to go on being an actor, and his sons after
him, but Chinatown here is different, and it’s getting
to lose some of the old strictness.</p>

<p class='c000'>What Moy Kip was going to do, was to smuggle
opium. He’d been wanting to go into it for a
long time, but he had nobody to help him at it, nobody
he could trust, that is. With me to take hold,
he reckoned he could make right smart of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>We bought a naphtha launch and filled it with nets
and truck, like we were fishing, if anybody wanted
to inspect us; and Kip had fixed the stewards on
about every China steamer coming into port. They
bought the stuff in five-tael tins, and packed it in
bales with lines and floats, dropping it overboard as
the ship crossed the bar. Then all we had to do
was to cruise around in the launch and pick up the
floats and haul in the bale. It was my part of the
business to dispose of the opium after we had got it
into town. I sold it to a German who distributed
it through Chinatown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first year I was perfectly happy with Moy
Kip, and no white man could have treated me better
than he did. He named me “Hak Chu”—the black
pearl—and nothing was too good for me. But still
we didn’t count for much in Chinatown, for Moy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Kip was still considered an actor, and below the
notice of merchants. It seemed to be as much a
question of money as anywhere else in the world,
and until we could save enough up to buy a share
in some store, we were less than nobody, except at
the theatre, where they were always glad to see us
both. We often went to see the plays, until, with
my husband’s explanations, I got so I could follow
the acting pretty well.</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s right interesting when you begin to understand,
for everything in the theatre means something.
Moy Kip explained to me how the carved
and gilded dragon over the doors leading to the
dressing-rooms meant a water-spout, and the sign
beside it read, “Go out and change costume.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They have lots of different kinds of plays, and
some of them take weeks to go through, running
night after night until all the doings of the hero are
finished.</p>

<p class='c000'>One night while we were sitting on the stage in
the theatre watching a new Wae, or painted-face
comedian, who had come from China to take Moy
Kip’s place, a man came to my husband with a
letter. You know, in Chinese theatres they have
a special column where letters for anybody in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>audience can be pinned up, and this one had been
seen by some one who knew Kip was there. When
he read it I could see that it had bad news. He
got up right off, and told me we must go home.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we were safe in our house, he told me
what was the matter. The letter was from the president
of a highbinder tong. They had discovered
that we were making money some way, and now
that if Moy Kip didn’t pay five thousand dollars
right off, he would be murdered by their hatchet-men.
Oh, I was scared! I tried to make my husband
promise to pay the hush-money, but he just
wouldn’t do it. He said he might as well die as
be robbed of all he had earned at so much risk.
He said he wasn’t afraid, but if he wasn’t, I was.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time on, I had the horrors every time
he left me. While we were together on our trips
on the launch, I didn’t care so much, for the excitement
kept up my spirits, but as soon as I was left
alone I burned punks in front of his little joss, just
like I was a heathen myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>All went on so quiet that I had begun to feel
easier, when yesterday the City of Pekin was reported.
It was after dark before we got out to our
wharf and put off, and we passed the steamer at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the Quarantine Station. It was cold and foggy, and
we spent hours cruising out at the mouth of the harbor,
in a rough swell, before we picked up the opium
and steamed back to Hunter’s Point.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we stopped the engines and shot up to the
pier, I was steering in the bow, and Moy Kip was
at the engine. Just then I saw two men rise up
from behind a pile on the dock. I screamed to my
husband to reverse the engine and back off at full
speed, and he had just done it when the highbinders
jumped into the boat. The shock nearly rolled
her over, and I fell down on my face. Before I
could get up, I saw the hatchet-men strike at Moy
Kip two or three times. I drew my pistol and fired,
but the launch was rolling, so I reckon I missed them.
They jumped into the water and swam off. Then
I called out to Moy Kip and ran aft to help him.</p>

<p class='c000'>My husband didn’t answer. I stooped down to
him and turned him over—oh, it was horrible!—and
then I must have swooned away, for it’s the
last thing I remember.</p>

<p class='c000'>I know the ways of these hired hatchet-men.
They’ve been sold out time after time by their own
members, and so now when they go out for a murder
they write down a confession with both names signed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>on the same paper. Then they tear it up and divide
the pieces, each one having the other’s name to hold
him by, if his partner tries to sell him out. Wong
Yet’s confession is on this paper you found. He’ll
die to-night—murderers can be bought cheap in
Chinatown. Now, if I only had the other half of
the paper I’d know who the second man was, and
settle him, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the dilapidated laundry wagon had
threaded the Mission, crossed Market Street, and
was rolling along the asphalt of Golden Gate
Avenue on its way to the Chinese Quarter. The
quadroon woman’s eyes were afire with hate, and
Vango watched her in apprehension, mingled with a
shrewd desire to work further upon her excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see I was able to be of assistance, even
when conditions was unfavorable,” he ventured.
“The spirits is unfallible to instruct when a party approaches
’em right. If I could give you a regular sittin’
and get into perfect harmony with the vibrations
of my control’s magnetism, I ain’t no doubt I could
lead you to find the balance of that there paper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The wheel of the wagon caught in the street-car
rail and the medium was jerked almost off his seat.
Or, so an observer might have explained the sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>lurch and the way Vango’s face went white. But
his imagination or mania, kindled again by the craft
of his trickery, had conjured up the vision of his
previous dupe, and Mrs. Higgins’s spirit arose before
him in threatening attitude. He cowered and stared,
exorcising the phantom, rubbing his hands in terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the quadroon woman did not notice. Her
mind, too, was full of horrors, and the desire for
vengeance was an obsession. She only replied,
“One thousand dollars if you find that piece of paper
before night!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE HERO’S ADVENTURE: THE MYSTERY OF THE HAMMAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>“Ten cents!” Admeh Drake muttered to
himself, as he felt the first shock of the cool
breeze on Kearney Street, “what in Jericho
can a man do with a dime, anyway? It won’t even
buy a decent bed; it won’t pay the price of a drink
at the Hoffman Bar. Coffee John is full of prunes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked up the cheap side of the street, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>aimlessly at the shop windows. “I figure it out
about this way,” he thought, “I ain’t going to earn
a million with two nickels; if I make a raise, it’ll be
just by durn luck. So it don’t matter how I begin,
nor what I do at all. I just got to go it blind, and
trust to striking a trail that’ll lead to water. I’ll
take up with the first idea I get, and ride for it as
far as it goes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this decision, he gave up the unnecessary
strain of thought and floated with the human current,
letting it carry him where it would. Now the main
Gulf Stream of San Francisco life sets down Kearney
and up Market Street; this is the Rialto, the
promenade of cheap actors, rounders and men about
town. It is the route of the amatory ogler and the
grand tour of the demi-monde. Of a Saturday
afternoon the course is given over to human peacocks
and popinjays, fresh from the matinees, airing “the
latest” in garb and finery; but there is a late guard
abroad after the theatres close in the evening, when
the relieving prospect of an idle morrow gives a
merry license for late hours and convivial comradeship.
Among these raglans and opera-cloaks,
Admeh’s rusty brown jacket was carried along like
an empty bottle floating down stream.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>He turned into Market Street at Lotta’s Fountain,
and had drifted a block northerly, when the
brilliant letters of an electric sign across the way
caught his eye: “Biograph Theatre. Admittance,
ten cents.” The hint was patent and alluring; there
seemed to be no gainsaying such a tip from Fate.
Over he went with never a thought as to where he
would spend the night without money, and in two
minutes Coffee John’s dime slid under the window
of the little ticket office in front. “Hurry up!”
said the man in the box, “the performance is just
about to begin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh made his way upstairs, passed through
a corridor lined with a cheap and unnecessary display
of dried fishes in a long glass case, and came to
the entrance of a dingy hall, dimly illuminated. At
the far end of the sloping floor was a Lilliputian
stage. A scant score of spectators were huddled
together on the front seats and here Admeh took
his place, between two soldiers in khaki uniform and
a fat negress.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he sat down, the curtain rose and two comedians
entered, to go through a dreary specialty turn
of the coarsest “knockabout” description. Admeh
yawned. Even the negress was bored, and the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>infantry corporals sneered openly. Next came a
plump lady of uncertain age who carolled a popular
song and did a frisky side-step to the chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh was gloomily disappointed. He turned
his head to inspect the audience more closely, hoping
for some livelier prompting of his destiny, when with
a trill and a one—two—three accompaniment upon
the wheezy piano at the side of the stage, a little
soubrette ran down to the footlights, and with a
mighty fetching seriousness, rolling her eyes to the
ceiling, proclaimed: “Ladies and gentlemen, with
your kind permission, I will now endeavor to entertain
you with a few tricks of sleight-of-hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a wee thing with wistful brown eyes
under a curly blond wig, and seemingly a mere
child. Her costume was a painful combination of
blue and violet, home-made beyond a doubt. No
one could help looking a guy in such a dress, but
Maxie Morrow, as the placard on the proscenium
announced her, had a childish ingenuousness that forfended
criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she went through her foolish little performance,
audibly coached by some one in the wings, Admeh’s
eyes followed her with eager interest. He wondered
how much older she was than she looked, and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>she would be like off the stage. She had a piquant
rather than a pretty face, in form that feline triangle
depicted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. In her movements
she was as graceful and as swiftly accurate as a
kitten, and she had all a kitten’s endearing and
alluring charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh made a sudden resolve. If he were to
meet with an adventure that night, what could possibly
be more entertaining than to have for his
heroine this little puss of a magician? He made a
rapid study of the situation to discover its possibilities.
It took but a few minutes for his wishes to
work out a plan of action, and he was soon at the
door urbanely addressing the ticket-taker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here,” said Admeh, “I’m a reporter on the
<cite>Wave</cite>—you know the paper, weekly illustrated—and
I want an interview with Miss Morrow. I’ll
give her a good write-up if you’ll let me go behind
and talk to her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Biograph Theatre did not often figure in the
dramatic columns of the city papers, and such a free
advertisement was not to be refused. The doorkeeper
became on the instant effusively polite and,
bustling with importance, took the young man down
a side aisle to a door and up three stairs through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>passage leading behind the wings. Admeh was
shown into a tiny dressing-room whose scrawled
plaster walls were half covered with skirts, waists,
and properties of all kinds. The little magician was
in front of her make-up table, dabbing at the rouge
pot. The doorkeeper introduced the visitor, then
discreetly withdrew, closing the door after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At her discovery by this audacious representative
of the press, Maxie was all smiles and blushes.
She was still but little more than a girl, although not
quite so young as she had appeared in front of the
footlights, and more naïve and embarrassed than one
would have expected of such a determined little
actress. She offered Admeh her own chair, the
only one in the room, but he seated himself upon a
trunk and began the conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>All his tact was necessary to put her at her ease
and induce her to talk. The Hero of Pago Bridge
was by no means too ready with his tongue, usually,
in the presence of women, but there was something
in the touching admiration she betrayed for him as
a newspaper man that prevented him from being
bashful. He thought the brotherly attitude to be
the proper pose, under the circumstances, and he led
her on, talking of the theatre, the weather, her costume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and himself, while she sat awkwardly conscious
of her violet tights, which she slapped nervously
with a little whip. His careless, friendly way at
last gave her confidence, for he asked her few questions
and did not seem to expect clever replies.
Before long she had thrown off all reserve and
chatted freely to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Biograph Theatre kept open, as a rule, as
long as it could secure patronage. This night stragglers
kept coming in, so that the four “artists” and
the picture machine in the room below still went
through their weary routine. As the conversation
proceeded, Maxie left at times, went through her act
and returned, finding Admeh always ready to put
her upon the thread of her story.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, by bits and snatches, by repetitions and
parentheses, in an incident here and a confession
there, this is about the way Admeh Drake heard,
that night, in Maxie Morrow’s dressing-room</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE MINOR CELEBRITY</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I can’t really remember when I wasn’t acting,
and I have no idea who my parents were, or
where I was born, or when, or anything. I
think, though, I must be about nineteen years old,
though I don’t look it, and I have decided on the
first of July for my birthday, because that’s just the
middle of the year and it can’t possibly be more
than six months wrong. I used to go on in child’s
parts in London when I couldn’t have been more
than four.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, the next thing I remember, I was with a
company of Swiss bell-ringers, and we travelled all
through the English provinces. I used to sing and
dance in between their turns, and I tell you it was
hard work, practising all day and dancing all night,
almost. We were all fearfully poor, for we weren’t
very much of an attraction. I had only one frock
beside my stage costume, and that one was so
patched I was ashamed to go to the pork shop, even,
with it on. I was a regular little slave to old Max,
who ran the company, and had to help cook and
wash the dishes in the lodgings we took in the little
towns. Bah! I hate the smell of brown Windsor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>soap to this day. I was just a little wild animal,
for I never went to school a day in my life, and I
was never allowed to go out on errands alone, unless
they kept account of the exact time it would take
to go and come, and they held me to account for
every minute. I hardly think I ever talked to a child
till I was grown up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the business fell off in England, so we took
passage in a sailing ship for California, around the
Horn. That voyage was the happiest time of my
life, for I had nothing to do but practise my steps
one or two hours a day, when the sea was calm
enough. There was a very nice old lady aboard
who taught me how to sew, and gave me some flannel
to make myself some underwear, for I had never
worn anything but what showed before, and I didn’t
even know that anyone else ever did. She taught
me to read, too, and tried to help me with arithmetic,
but mercy! I never could get figures into my
head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, we got to San Francisco finally—that was
about ten years ago. Bell-ringing didn’t seem to
take very well; it was out of date, or other people
did it better, because you know specialty people have
to keep improving their act, and play on their heads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>or while they’re tumbling through the air, or some
novelty, nowadays, or it doesn’t go and it’s hard to
get booked. But my act drew well, and it always
saved our turn. I made up new steps all the time
and invented pretty costumes, and so, of course, old
Max watched me like grim death to see that I didn’t
get away from him. We travelled all over the
West, and all the time I was a drudge, did most of
the work and got none of the money. They used
to lock me into the house when they went out, and
old Max’s wife would give me so much work to do
that she’d know whether I’d been idle a moment.
You wouldn’t think a girl in a fix like that had much
chance to get married, would you?</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I am married, or rather I was. I don’t
know just how I stand now. Let me tell you about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a man used to hang about the Star
Variety Theatre in Los Angeles, who did small
parts sometimes, when they wanted a policeman in
a sketch, or things like that, but he mostly helped
with the scene-shifters. I never had more than a
few words with him, but he kind of took a fancy to
me, and he used to bring me candy and leave it behind
the flats where the others wouldn’t see it. I don’t
believe, now, he ever cared so very much for me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>but I was silly and had never had any attention, and
I thought he was in love with me, and I imagined I
was with him. He tried to make up to Max, but
the old man wouldn’t have anything to do with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, when all my people were out and had
locked me in the house, with a lot of dishes to wash,
Harry—his name was Harry Maidslow—came
down the street and saw me at the kitchen window.
I raised the sash when he came into the yard, and
without waiting for much talk first, for we were both
afraid the old man would be coming back and
would catch us, Harry asked me if I didn’t want to
leave the show, and if I wouldn’t run away with
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe I told him I’d run away with an orangoutang
if I got the chance. Remember, I was only
seventeen, and I had never been alone with a man
in my life before. In my life—if you call such
slavery as that, living! So he told me not to appear
to notice him, but to be all ready for him and to
watch out, and when I heard a certain whistle he
taught me, wherever I was, to jump and run for him,
and he’d do the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>You can imagine if I wasn’t excited for the next
few days! I would have jumped off the roof to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>to him, if necessary, and I just waited from hour to
hour, expecting to hear his call every minute. I
didn’t hardly dare to go to sleep at night for fear I’d
miss him, and I was listening everywhere I went,
meals and all. I think I trembled for three days.
It seemed impossible that he’d be able to get me
away; it was too good to come true. But I had
nothing else in the world to look forward to, and I
hoped and prayed for that whistle with all my
might.</p>

<p class='c000'>One night at the theatre, after my company had
done the first part of their bell-ringing, I went on for
my song. I remember it was that purple silk frock
I wore, the one with the gold fringe, and red stockings
with bows at the knees. Well, the orchestra
had just struck up my air—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ain’t I the cheese? Ain’t I the cheese?</div>
      <div class='line'>Dancing the serpentine under the trees!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and I was just ready to catch the first note when I
heard that whistle so loud and clear I couldn’t mistake
it. Heavens! I can almost hear it now. I
was half frightened to death, but I just shut my eyes
and jumped clean over the footlights and landed in
the flageolet’s lap and then pelted right up the middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>aisle. Harry had a lot of his friends ready by the
main entrance, and they rushed down to meet me and
while half of them held the ushers and the crowd
back, for everyone was getting up to see what was
the matter, like a panic, the rest of the boys took me
by the elbows and ran me out the front door. The
house was simply packed that night, and when they
all saw me jump they set up a yell like the place
was afire. But I didn’t hear it at all till I got out in
the corridor with my skirt half torn off and my
dancing clogs gone—and then the noise sounded like
a lion roaring in a menagerie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harry was all ready waiting for me, and he took
me right up in his arms, as if I was a doll, ran
down the stairs, put me in a carriage waiting at the
door, and we drove off, lickety-split.</p>

<p class='c000'>I’ve often thought since then that I took a big
risk in trusting a man I didn’t really know at all, but
Harry was square, and took me right down to a
justice of the peace. We were married just as I
stood, with no slippers and the holes in the heels of
my stockings showing. What old Max did, I don’t
know, but he must have been a picture for the
audience when he saw me fly away like a bird out
of a cage. By the time he found out what had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>happened it was too late to do anything about it, for
I was Mrs. Maidslow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I lived with Harry for a few months, and
then he began to drink and wanted me to go on the
stage again to support him. The first time he
struck me I ran away and came up to San Francisco,
and went into specialty work for myself. Harry
was kind enough when he was sober; in fact, he
was too good-natured to refuse even a drink; that
was just what was the matter. He had no backbone,
and although he had a sort of romantic way
with him that women like he didn’t have the nerve
to stay with anything very long.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the funny part of the whole thing is this.
You’d think that old Max would have been furious,
and so he was at first, but afterward he had a terrible
falling out with the others in his company—his
wife had died—and I guess he wanted to spite
them more than he did me. At any rate, just before
he died, a year ago, he inherited some money
from an uncle in Germany, and what did he do but
leave a kind of a legacy to Harry. That is, the
old man had a funny idea that wills didn’t hold
very well in this country, and he had a great respect
for the honor of the army officers. So he left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>$15,000 in cash with a Colonel Knowlton in trust
for Harry Maidslow when he could be found.
Harry had a way of changing his name when he
felt like it, and old Max didn’t know him very well,
anyway, so the only way he could be sure of Colonel
Knowlton identifying him was by—well, by a
certain mark he had on his body that Max happened
to know about. The colonel has been invalided
home from the Philippines, and every time
he sees me he asks me if I’ve found Harry.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, that’s all. I don’t really know whether I’m
a wife or a widow, but I do know that I ought to
have a share of that money coming to me, and perhaps
if you put the story into the paper, some of
his friends will see it and give me news of him.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Admeh Drake put his pencil into his pocket feeling
a sense of shame at his duplicity with this little
waif. He would have been glad to help her, but
it seemed useless to disappoint her credulity by confessing
that his relations with the press were entirely
fictitious. “Well, I hope you get the money,” he
said, “and if there’s anything I can do to help you,
I will. But don’t you want me to see you home,
Maxie?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“Sure!” said the girl, frankly, and after pulling
on a rather soiled automobile coat and adjusting a
top-heavy plumed black hat, she descended the
stairs of the theatre with Admeh and they found
themselves on Market Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a little late to get anything to eat,” Admeh
suggested, tentatively, trusting to his luck. He was
not disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, indeed,” replied the girl. “I always
have supper after I get home, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Half the worry was off his mind, but without a
cent in his pocket, the question of transportation
troubled him. If worst came to worst, Admeh decided
that he would take Maxie home in a carriage,
see her safely indoors, and then return and have it
out with the driver. But first he ventured another
insinuation. “It’s a beautiful night!” he remarked.
At that moment the fog enveloped the upper half
of the Spreckels Building, and the tall and narrow
column was visible only as an irregular pattern of
soft, blurred yellow lights.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fine!” said Maxie. “Let’s walk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took his arm blithely, happy at her release
from work, and they crossed over, went up Grant
Avenue to Post Street and there turned toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Union Square. A short distance ahead of them a
tall man in a gray mackintosh was walking with
somewhat painful carefulness up the street. His
deviations seemed to testify to a rather jovial evening’s
indulgence. The two rapidly approached
him, and Admeh had scarcely time to notice his
yellow beard and hair when the stranger turned
into a doorway. The house he entered was gaudily
painted in red and yellow with stars and crescents,
and so fiercely lighted with electric lamps that no
wayfarer, however dazed, could fail to notice the
sign: “Hammam Baths—Gentlemen’s Entrance.”
When Admeh turned to Maxie she was as pale as
if she had seen a ghost. She looked up at him with
a glitter in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here!” she exclaimed, opening her purse and
thrusting a dollar into his hand. “Go in there and
see if that man who just went in has the word
’Dotty’ tattooed on his right arm! Find out who
he is, and come to the theatre and tell me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With that she pushed him into the doorway and
was gone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>THE MYSTERY OF THE HAMMAM</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>With the enthusiasm of an amateur detective,
Admeh Drake paid his dollar for
admission, and passed through two anterooms
into an artificially tropical atmosphere.
Turkish baths were a luxury outside the scheme of
things; he knew nothing of the arrangements. He
paused, uncertain how to proceed; uncertain, too,
as to the best plan for catching the yellow-bearded
man stripped. While he hesitated, an attendant
showed him into a dressing-room. He saw naked
men passing with towels twisted about their loins.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the first time in many days, he took off his
wrinkled, creased clothes. Pausing on the balcony
without the door, he surveyed the carpeted, gaudily
decorated apartment below. It was midnight, the
busiest hour of the twenty-four in the baths. Heavier
than the atmosphere of steam and steamed humanity
rose the fumes of liquor. Few there are sober in
a Hammam at that elbow of the night. Not knowing
that the sweating heat takes the edge and fervor
from the wildest intoxication, Admeh wondered,
as he watched, at the subdued murmur of their
babblings. His eye ranged over a group sitting up
in towel robes, chatting drowsily, over a drunken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>satyr thrusting his heavy limbs from under the covers
and singing a sleepy tune, over two others sunk in
stupor. Beyond them was a group of jockeys, who
had come to reduce weight; all were young, small,
keen-eyed, each was puffing a huge cigar. In that
bower of transformation, where all men stood equal
as at the judgment, their worldly goods shrunk to a
single bath towel, he found it hard to pick his man,
yet no one could he see with the clay-yellow hair
and beard that marked the mysterious person for
whom he was searching.</p>

<p class='c000'>Following others who slipped down the stairs in
the single, levelling garment, Admeh went across
the main salon, through a double glass door, and
into an ante-chamber considerably hotter, where
men were lolling back, wet and shiny, in canvas
chairs. He saw the rubbers working in the room
beyond, saw that the men under their hands were
black and brown of hair and beard.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the right, another glass door caught his eye.
He passed in and gasped at the heavy, overpowering
temperature. His glasses, to which he had
clung with the instinct of a near-sighted man, burned
on his nose. Men, glistening and dripping, sat all
along the wall, their feet in little tubs of water.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>In the corner sat the mysterious stranger of the
yellow hair and beard. He was singing sentimentally.
Admeh, practised in the lore of intoxication,
watched him. “The jag’s growing,” he said to
himself. In fact, the fumes of liquor, heat driven,
were mounting steadily. Crossing the room, so as to
command the stranger’s right side, he saw round his
upper arm a black rubber bandage, like those used
to confine varicose veins. The problem resolved
itself into a question of tearing off that bandage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hotter’n the hazes of the Philippines!”
babbled the man with the yellow beard. Piecing
together the description of her husband given by
Maxie in the story of her adventures, Admeh was
more than ever persuaded that this was the object
of his search, that under the elastic bandage was
the mark of identification by which he was to know
the legatee of the fortune left by the old bell-ringer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man of the yellow beard sang maudlin Orpheum
songs and prattled of many things. He cursed
San Francisco. He told of his amours. He offered
to fight or wrestle with anyone in the room. “A
chance,” thought Admeh, as he took the challenge.
But in a moment more, the drunken man was running
again on a love-tack, with the winds of imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>blowing free. Nevertheless, this challenge
gave Admeh an idea. What he could not encompass
by diplomacy he might seize by force. In that
method, all must depend upon the issue of a moment.
If he could tear away the bandage in the first
dash he would win. But let the struggle last more
than a moment and others would intervene; then he
would be thrown out and the chance would be gone.
Mentally he measured bodies against the stranger;
man for man he saw that, both being sober, he himself
was badly over-matched. Broader and taller by
many inches, the stranger was of thick, knotty limbs,
and deep chest; Admeh himself was all cowboy
nerve and wire, but slight and out of condition. It
was bull against coyote.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The question is,” thought Admeh, “can I and
his jag lick him and his muscle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The stranger, singing again, lurched along the
hot tiling to another room. Admeh gasped like a
hooked trout as he followed through the door. It
was the extra-hot room, where the mercury registered
one hundred and sixty degrees. The stranger’s
bristles began to subside and his lips crept
together. The amateur detective drew nearer and,
languid as he was with the terrific heat, gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>his force for the attempt. At that moment an attendant
with trays of ice water slouched in on his
felt shoes. Admeh slipped back into his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>This entrance had a most surprising effect on
him of the yellow beard. Some emotion, which
Admeh took to be either fear or anxiety, struggled
to break through the veil of his debauch; he
stared with bleary but intent eyes. In a moment
he was lurching for the door. Glad of the relief
from that overwhelming heat, Admeh followed.
The trail led through the anteroom, past the rubbers
and their benches, through another double
glass door. A rush of steam fogged his spectacles;
when it cleared a little, he saw dimly, through the
hot vapor, that he was in a long, narrow closet,
banked on one side by benches and by pipes which
were vomiting clouds of steam. Groping from one
side to the other, he found that they were quite
alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>With no further hesitation, Admeh rushed on
his man and grasped for the right arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the fraction of an inch he missed his hold.
The stranger, with a quickness amazing for one in
his condition—and what was more surprising, without
a word—lashed out and caught Admeh a blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>under the chest which whirled him back on the hot
benches and fairly jerked his spectacles from his
nose. The issue was on, and it was first honors
for the stranger. Unsteady on his legs, but still
determined, Admeh closed again, ducked under a
ponderous blow and grappled round the waist. He
managed to get one hand on the bandage, but in no
wise could he tear it away, for the stranger held
him in a bear-grip, tight about the neck. So they
struggled and grunted and swayed through the
misty clouds from the hot benches to the slippery
floor and back to the benches again. Their bodies,
what with the exertion and the steam, ran rivulets;
their throats were gasping. Once, twice, they
staggered the room’s length. Admeh was beginning
to feel his breath and his senses going together,
when the grasp about his neck slackened in tension.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I and the jag win,” he thought, with what
sense was left in him. He gathered his strength
into its last cartridge, and gave a heave and a fling;
they went down to the floor with a wet slap, Admeh
above. He felt his opponent collapse under
him. For a moment he, too, saw the universe
swing round him, but with a great effort he tore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>away the bandage and pressed his near-sighted
eyes close to the right arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, in faded colours, was a tattooed design on
the white skin. Admeh made out the word
“Dotty,” framed in a border of twisted snakes. His
quest was done. Faint, weary, languid, he prepared
to get away before his assault was discovered.
The door opened; some one caught
Admeh by the arm. With no more fight in him,
he raised himself to one knee and recognised the
attendant, the sight of whom had before so nearly
sobered his drunken opponent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What the devil——” said the new-comer, and
stopped as his eye caught that mark on the arm.
Then he bent down, passed his finger over the design,
studied it, and peered into the white, senseless
face behind the yellow beard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My work—it is the very man!” he exclaimed,
in tones of the greatest interest. Turning to Admeh
he asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now why did <em>you</em> want to know about that
mark, and what were you scrapping for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you know about him?” retorted
Admeh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Story for story,” said the attendant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Story for story, swapped sight unseen,” agreed
Admeh. “But let’s get him out of here first, because
he’s in a pretty bad fix between his fight and
his jag.” Together they carried him to a dressing-room,
laid him on a bench, and closed the curtain.
Here Admeh’s last spark of strength left him; he
collapsed in a heap on the floor. With practised
hands the attendant set about reviving them both.
In ten minutes the man of mystery slept heavily, stupidly,
on the bench, and Admeh was sitting against
the wall breathing cool relief from the outer air.
Briefly, he told of his singular errand, omitting, from
some hazy idea of policy, the item about the
legacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the rubber, after Admeh Drake
had finished his tale, “your yarn certainly is curious,
but I can beat it. What d’you think of this?—I
tattooed that name and mark on this fellow’s arm,
and I know the history of it, but he has no idea to
this day how it ever come there, nor who ’Dotty’
is, nor why I did it, nor anything at all about it.
He was the hero of as queer a yarn as I ever heard,
and he knew no more about it all the time than a
babe unborn!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He rang an electric bell; a boy answered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Tell the boss to send for the extra man,” he
said. “I’m done up for to-night, and I’m going to
lay off for a while.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying, he took Drake into an adjoining room,
shared by the employees of the baths, and, after
making himself comfortable on a lounge with a
blanket wrapper, he told the following joyous
romance:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE DERMOGRAPH ARTIST</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>You see, this ain’t my regular job. I’m working
here because my profession is played
out in San Francisco. I’m a dermograph
artist. What’s that? Oh, it’s what most people
call a tattooer. But don’t you think we’ve got as
much right to be called artists as the fellows that
slap paint on cloth with a brush? I think so. Is
anything nicer than the human skin? Don’t you
fix up your walls and your ceilings, and your floors
that you wipe your feet on? Then what’s the
matter with decorating yourself? That’s the line of
talk I always gave people when they asked me why
I called myself a dermograph artist.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>It was the electric needle and the Jap tattooer
that ran me out of business. With the electric
needle, a man could put on a design in about a
quarter of the time that it takes to do a real artistic
job by hand. The blamed little Jap would pretty
near pay to get a customer, he worked that cheap.
I quit, and I never get out my needles now except
for a design on some one in the baths.</p>

<p class='c000'>My parlours were on the water-front, because
most of my customers were sailors. Of course,
once in a while some swells from Nob Hill would
come in for a design or two. I used to do my best
work for them, because, I thought, you never can
tell when these society people will get next to the
fact that a picture on the skin has it a mile on a painting.
Why, the other day I read in the papers that
a Frenchman got a hundred thousand dollars for a
little, dinky canvas painting. The highest pay I ever
knew a dermograph artist to get was five hundred
for doing the Wells Brothers’ tattooed woman. Do
you call that square?</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Jap and the electric needle chump came
to town, business fell off, as I was telling you.
They’d have made me close up my shop and get
out if it hadn’t been for Spotty Crigg. Ever hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of him? Well, you sure haven’t been in San
Francisco long. In those days he kept a sailor
boarding-house and saloon round the corner from
my parlours, and he was sort of boss of the water-front—good
any time to deliver five hundred votes.
I ain’t saying that Spotty was a Sunday-school kind
of man, but he stuck to his friends. I was one of
the gang, so he sent me enough jobs to keep me
going. Besides, I helped him once or twice on a
shanghaing deal. You see, like most sailor boarding-house
keepers in those days, he was a crimp—used
to deliver a sailor or two when foremast hands
were scarce and the pay was good. Spotty Crigg
is dead now, or I wouldn’t be telling you about his
last and biggest shanghaing scrape. I didn’t understand
it at the time, but I learned about it afterward,
part from Crigg and part from people on the
other side of the little deal.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of my society customers was young Tom
Letterblair. Maybe you don’t know about him,
either. He belonged to about the richest tribe of
swells on Nob Hill. That fellow was as wild as
a fish-hawk, a thoroughbred dead game sport. His
being wild didn’t bother his people so much as the
way he went about it—always doing something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>crazy. His people were strong on getting into the
society columns of the papers, but he was eternally
getting the family name on the news pages of the yellow
journals, if not in the police reports. He wasn’t
really what you would call bad, either; only wild
and careless and brought up wrong, and stubborn
about it when anyone tried to call him down. He’d
never seem sorry if he got the family into trouble,
but just laugh at his sisters when they roasted him.
And instead of treating him quiet and easy, and
gentling him into being good, they’d jaw him. That’s
a bad scheme with a gilded youth like Tom Letterblair.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were a bunch of orphans. That was half
the trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, Tom Letterblair took up with a chorus
girl and refused to drop her. The family tried to
buy her off. Now she wasn’t a nice sort of girl,
but she was true to Tom. She told him about it.
For once, although he was such a careless fellow,
he got mad and what does he do but come to me to
have her name, “Dotty,” tattooed on his arm with
the double snake border. Says he to me confidentially,
“That’s the girl I’m going to marry when I
come of age, which is only two months, and don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>you forget it.” Seems that he told other people the
same thing, so that it came back to his family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now his sisters and the Eastern society swells
that they were married to didn’t hanker any to have
Dotty for a sister-in-law. But they knew by experience
that if Tom Letterblair said he’d do it, all
blazes wouldn’t hold him. J. Thrasher Sunderland,
one of Tom’s brothers-in-law, had what he thought
was a bright idea. It was to get the kid shanghaied
on a sailing vessel off for a six months’ voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>That wasn’t such a bad scheme either. They
could keep him away from Dotty and drink for six
months, have him work hard, and make a man out
of him. It’s been done before right in this port.
That wild streak is a kind of disease that strikes
young fellows with too much blood in their necks
and money in their pockets. I know. I’ve had it
myself, bar the money. By six months, what doctors
call the crisis would have been over. The risky
thing was the chance of raising a howl when he got
back, but they were willing to take chances that the
sense knocked into him with a belaying pin would
make him see it their way. They were going to
give it out to the papers and their friends that he
was off for his health.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>J. Thrasher Sunderland made his first break when
he went to Captain Wynch of the bark <em>Treasure
Trove</em>, instead of going straight to a crimp, as he
ought to have done. Wynch promised to treat the
kid well and try to brace him up. Never having
seen Tom Letterblair he got a description of him,
including the tattoo mark. Then the skipper went
to Spotty Crigg and promised him a hundred dollars
for doing the rough work of getting Tom on
board the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Letterblair was such a big, careless fellow, he
never suspected anything, and a lure note fetched
him to Crigg’s saloon the night before the bark
cleared. Tom had been drinking hard that day—showed
up badly slewed. ’Twas a jolly drunk,
and he was ready for a glass with anyone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, Crigg hadn’t given much thought to this
little transaction, for he was doing that sort of work
almost every day in the week. But when that young
swell, all dressed up to the nines, came into the
“Bowsprit” saloon, the looks of him put a brand-new
idea into Spotty’s noddle. It struck him that
a hundred dollars was pretty small pay for catching
a fish of that size and colour; there was evidently
a big deal on somewhere. Like everyone else that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>read the papers, he knew considerable about Tom
Letterblair, knew him for a young sport, free as
water with his money. Putting two and two together,
he saw that if he could save the kid instead
of stealing him, there might be a good many times
a hundred in the affair. Besides, there was a chance
of finding out who was trying to get the shanghaing
done, and then collecting blackmail. So he decided
to play both ends. He would steal the wrong man,
and hold on to the right one.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ran his eye around the place and saw Harry
Maidslow, a scene-shifter in the old Baldwin Theatre,
who used to drop in, now and then, on his
nights off. Man for man, Maidslow and Letterblair
were modelled on the same lines—Maidslow
wore a moustache, but that would come off easy
enough—yellow hair, blue eyes, big and strong
build. Maidslow hadn’t a relative this side of the
Rockies; no one would miss him. Crigg knew
that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spotty Crigg went so far in his mind before he
thought of the tattoo mark. Captain Wynch had
mentioned it as the proof that there was no mistake.
And then, Crigg thought of me. I suppose lots of
people would have stopped there, but Spotty Crigg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>had nerve, I’ll say that for him—nerve of a thousand.</p>

<p class='c000'>He worked Letterblair to drink himself to sleep,
and then had him packed upstairs and put to bed,
dead to the world. The next move was easy. Crigg
took Harry Maidslow into his office, fed him knockout
drops, and carried him up into the same room
with Letterblair. Side by side he laid them both,
and stripped them to undershirts.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was the way I found them when a hurry
call brought me to the boarding-house. I thought
at first they were both dead. It gave me the horrors
to hear Crigg tell me that I was to copy that
tattoo mark. ’Twas like working on a dead man.
One drunk, the other drugged, lying on a little,
cheap old bed and Spotty, who wasn’t a nice,
clean-looking sort of person anyway, leaning over
them with a candle.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he told what he wanted, I kicked until he
put on the screws. He could drive me off the
water-front if he cared. I knew that, and he
reminded me of it, besides offering me fifty dollars.
So at last I went at it, he telling me all the time to
hurry. I never worked so fast in my life. By two
hours you couldn’t tell one mark from the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>except that Maidslow’s was new and Letterblair’s
old. Next we shaved Maidslow’s mustache off,
for Tom always wore a smooth face. Then we
changed their clothes, putting the swell rig on
Maidslow and the old clothes on Letterblair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, Spotty Crigg took Maidslow, got him into
a hack, drove him to a dory he had waiting, and
rowed out to the <em>Treasure Trove</em>, which was in the
stream waiting to sail next morning. Captain
Wynch was cussing purple because Spotty had been
so long. He went over the description, though,
and looked at the right arm to make sure, just as
Crigg expected him to do. It looked all right, because
a tattoo mark don’t begin to swell until the
day after; besides, Wynch was seeing it under a
fo’castle lamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all right so far. But Crigg, who wasn’t
so keen by a jugful as he thought he was, hadn’t
figured on one thing. The Letterblairs had an
aunt, Mrs. Burden, a widow without chick or child
of her own. She was an old, religious lady, with
oodles of money and a whopping temper—a regular
holy terror. She didn’t cotton to the sisters at
all; in fact, hated them, but she was soft over Tom
Letterblair. Whenever she wasn’t turning loose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>her money, stringing hospitals and churches all the
way to Sacramento, she was handing it over to the
kid, who had only an allowance until he got to be
twenty-one. He and the parsons were the only
ones who got her to loosen up. She had no son
and I rather guess that on the quiet she had a
sneaking liking for the way he was carrying on.
Sort of thrilled her. You know how some of those
pious old girls like a man that’s real bad. She
coddled him to death and fought the sisters for
being hard on the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spotty’s luck turned so that she picked the very
next morning for a show-down with the sisters over
the way they were treating the kid. There must
have been a regular hair-pulling. Anyway, before
they got through, Mrs. Sunderland was so mad
that she poured out the whole scheme in one mouthful.
She said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You won’t have a chance to coddle <em>him</em> any
more! He’s on the <em>Treasure Trove</em>, bound for
China to get the foolishness taken out of him. He’s
passed the Farralones by this time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The old lady was foxy. She would have made
a pretty good sport herself. She shut up like a
clam, went home, rushed for the telephone and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>called up the wharfinger. She found that the <em>Treasure
Trove</em> was in the stream being towed for the
heads, and belonged to Burke &amp; Coleman, this
port. She knew Burke. She got her carriage,
made his office in two jumps, and wouldn’t leave
until she had an order on Captain Wynch to deliver
a sailor answering Letterblair’s description, tattooing
and all. In a half-hour more she had a tug
started, chasing the <em>Treasure Trove</em> with that order.
She offered the crew two hundred dollars over
regular pay if they got their man back safe and
sound. She herself was afraid of the water, and
stayed in the tug office to wait.</p>

<p class='c000'>While this was going on, Tom Letterblair woke
up. The man watching him tried to get him drunk
again, and the jag turned out loud and nasty.
Crigg saw he’d have to be doing something right off
the bat.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew a little how the land lay between Tom
and his people, but not enough. He was sure that
some one of Tom’s relatives had done it. As far
as that he was right. He struck the wrong lead
when he picked Mrs. Burden as the one—she being
a church member—that was most likely to be
ashamed of the kid. He looked up her number in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the directory, and made for the house hot-foot. She
wasn’t in, so he held up a lamp-post, waiting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tug got back. They packed Harry Maidslow
into the dock-house. He was still sound asleep
from the knockout drops.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My precious boy!” said the old lady, and fell
on his neck. Then she screamed so you could hear
her all over the water-front and began to jump on
the captain. She said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re a pack of thieves! You’ve murdered
my Tom and dressed another man in his clothes.
Where is my boy? Give me back my boy!” she
said, and a lot of other things.</p>

<p class='c000'>Said the tug-boat captain: “You’re trying to get
out of paying the two hundred. He’s on specifications,
and a nice time we had making them pass him
over. Look here.” He got the coat off Harry
Maidslow. There was the tattoo mark, just beginning
to swell up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a new mark. You and those hussies have
fooled me,” said the old lady. “I’ll have you all
in jail for this,” she said. “I wish I could find him,
I’d show them up. I’d take him right up to the big
dance they’re going to have to-night. I’d shame
them!” she said. And she drove home, laughing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and crying out loud. At the doorstep Spotty Crigg
braced her.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began quiet and easy, working up her curiosity
so that she would let him know how the land
lay. That’s just where he went wrong again. In
about a minute she put two and two together and
saw pretty clearly through the whole scheme. She
was just one point smarter than Spotty, and she
wormed it out of him finally. He thought she
wanted Tom put out of the way, sure. She played
her hand by letting him think so. It was move and
your turn, like a game of checkers, with the old
lady one jump ahead. Said Spotty:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two thousand dollars, or I bring him back and
give the story to the <cite>Observer</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Which of course was exactly what she wanted.
She pretended to be scared but mad.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a cent. Do your worst,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I’ll go that one better,” said Spotty. “I see
by the papers there’s a dance at the Sunderland house
to-night. Three thousand down or I dump him in
the front door, drunk as a lord and dressed like a stevedore.
I’ve got him where you can’t find him——”
which was a bluff. “If you tell the police he’ll get
worse than a drunk——” which was another.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Not a red cent,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Settles it!” said Crigg. He went away red-hot,
mad enough to back up his bluff, just as the old
lady thought he would.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he got home he found that Tom couldn’t
be kept much longer. There had been a deuce of
a rough house. That clinched the matter with
Spotty Crigg. About half-past eight he woke Tom,
gave him some dinner with a cold bottle to get him
started again, and spun him a yarn about finding
him drunk and robbed. The deal went through
on schedule. At half-past nine, Spotty drove up
to the Letterblair house with the kid, rang the door-bell
and pushed Tom right into the hall, nursing a
loud, talkative drunk. They say it put that function
on the bum. I heard afterward from Tom
Letterblair that it was about the only time he ever
really enjoyed himself at one of his sister’s parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody ever told the police or the papers. Every
man-jack in the deal was afraid to peach on the
others, because he couldn’t afford to tell on himself.
All except the old lady and Tom, of course, and
they were too tickled with the way the things
turned out to care about giving it away. Another
funny thing: everybody quit a winner. You can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>see how Captain Wynch won. Tom paid Spotty
Crigg a thousand for keeping him off the <em>Treasure
Trove</em>, and I got fifty dollars for my job. And even
the snob sisters won out. How? Well, sir, Tom
Letterblair braced up from that time on. I suppose
he took it that if he was far enough gone to the
devil for his family to have to shanghai him, he
must be a pretty bad egg. So he swore off, got
on the water-wagon, and turned out pretty well,
alongside of what they’d expected of him. His
chorus girl, Dotty, ran away with another man, and
that helped him some, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, Tom got a case on a swell New York
heiress, a dizzy blonde, who was just simply It in
the Four Hundred. He married her, to the great
and grand delight of Mr. and Mrs. J. Thrasher
Sunderland.</p>

<p class='c000'>And right there was where Tom had too much
luck for any one man. I’ll be darned if that girl’s
name wasn’t Dotty, and she always believed Tom
had it pricked on his arm just on her account!
What d’you think of that?</p>

<p class='c000'>But perhaps you’re wondering how Maidslow
got square. I’ll tell you.</p>

<p class='c000'>He came to in the tug office, where the crew had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>passed him a few swift kicks and left him. Pretty
stupid and dopy yet, he crawled home to his own
room and slept some more of it off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, when his head did finally clear out, he
began to look himself over; to discover and explore,
as you might say. When he looked in the glass he
must have nearly fell dead. His yellow moustache
was gone. Then, he’d gone to sleep in old clothes
and he woke up in a swell high-class rig, silk-lined,
and without a spot, patch, or sign of wear. He
had on silk gauze underwear, patent leather shoes,
diamonds in his shirt-front, cuff-links, and a pair of
pretty hot socks. Feeling in his pockets, as a man
will, he found a gold watch and chain, a gold cigarette
case, a corkscrew mounted in rubies and three
hundred and forty-two dollars in bills and coin.
Every one in the deal had been too busy to touch
him while he was drugged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before he got his senses his arm began to
feel funny. After he’d investigated the costume, he
took off the Willy-boy coat and stripped up his
shirt sleeve. There was a tattoo mark, smarting
like sin, with the name “DOTTY” in beautiful capital
letters! Well, when he saw that he went right
up into the air. He was just like that old woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>in the nursery rhyme—“Lawk-a-massy on us, this
is none of I!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tattoo mark was his only clue. I was the
only one he knew in the business, so he came down
to me and wanted to know how, and when, and
where, and why, and what-the-devil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here, my son,” says I, “what are you
kicking about, anyway? You go to sleep with eight
dollars on your back and two bits in your jeans.
You wake up with about a seven hundred and fifty
dollar rig on, and a wad in your pocket, more than
you ever had in your life. The thing for you to do,”
I says, “is to lose yourself before you’re called for,
and to stay lost, good and hard! Next time you
fade away on the water-front, you may wake up in
a jumper and overalls, shovelling garbage! You
can’t expect to draw a straight flush in diamonds
every deal: next shuffle you may catch deuces. You
take my advice and drop a part of that roll of yours
for a ticket in the ’Owl’ train to-night, before you’re
enchanted back again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” he says, “I’ll do it. But for
heaven’s sake, tell me just one thing, and I’ll ask no
more questions. <em>Who in blazes is Dotty?</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aw,” I says, “she’s the fairy godmother of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>pipe dream. She’s changed into a sea-gull by this
time!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>“Well,” concluded the rubber, “he skipped, and
I have never seen him since, from that day till to-night,
when I found you scrapping with him, for this
man is Harry Maidslow for sure. If you want to
talk to him now, he’ll probably be all right. He’s
had time to have a plunge, and you’ll find him sleeping
upstairs. I’ve got to go home, so good-by.
Come round again some time and tell me about
him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh Drake, after a swim in the tank himself,
passed through the main salon and upstairs, acting
upon the hint of the Dermograph Artist. The place
was lined with cots, now filled with snoring occupants,
and it was not until he had explored a second
story that Admeh found him of the clay-yellow
beard. He was alone in a secluded ward, sleeping
peacefully. Admeh touched him, and Maidslow
sat up suddenly with a terrified stare.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What d’you want? What d’you want of me?”
he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh was astonished at his fright, but hastened
to relieve the man’s suspense. “Oh, nothing bad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>I hope. Is your name—” here he hesitated,
and the man’s face showed abject fear—“Maidslow?”—and
the mouth relaxed its tensity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the man. “What d’you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to tell you that there’s fifteen thousand
dollars coming to you!” said Drake.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man stared now in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ever know old Max Miller, Swiss bell-ringer?”
“A little,” said Maidslow. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s your rich uncle. He’s left you his fortune.
You caught him when you stole Maxie from
him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here,” said Maidslow, “what kind of a
jolly are you giving me anyway? I haven’t seen
Maxie—I suppose you mean my wife—for two
years. If you know anything about her, tell me the
whole thing, and tell it slow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For the second time that night Admeh Drake
narrated his adventures, beginning at Coffee John’s,
and ending with the news of Maxie and the legacy
left to Harry Maidslow. But, when he mentioned
Colonel Knowlton’s name as the trustee, Maidslow,
who had listened so far in delight, gave an exclamation
of despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, heavens!” he cried, “I can never get that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>money! Why couldn’t it have been given in charge
of some one else? Colonel Knowlton, of all men
in the world!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why can’t you get it from him?” Drake asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You listen to my story, and you’ll know,” replied
Maidslow.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STORY OF THE DESERTER OF THE PHILIPPINES</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>I don’t exactly know why I married Maxie
Morrow, except that I’ve always been a fool
about women. The thing came so sudden, I
just jumped and caught her on the fly. When she
left me, I went pretty much to the bad. Then
Harry Maidslow disappeared, because of debts and
one thing or another, and I turned up as Harry
Roberts in St. Louis. That was just about when
the Spanish war broke out. It was too good a chance
to lose, and I decided to begin all over again. So
I enlisted in the regulars, joining the One Hundred
and Fourteenth Infantry. I was hardly more than
through the goose step when we were sent to the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was no slouch nor shirk, either, but I knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>more about eating than anything else, and I naturally
gravitated to the cook’s tent and put him on to
a lot of things the boys liked. I got to be rather
popular with the company in this way, and when
the Commissary Sergeant was appointed in Manila,
I managed to get the place, though I was only a
rookie. Perhaps the Captain’s wife helped me out
some. She, being an officer’s lady, wasn’t supposed
to know I was on earth, but somehow she noticed
me and fixed it up easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commissary work was a snap—little drill, no
guard mount, leave of absence occasionally, and the
run of the town in a little pony cart. You see each
company had its quota of rations. We could draw
them, or leave them and get credit. There was
maple syrup and candy, canned fruit, and chocolate,
and all sorts of good stuff in the storehouse that we
could get at wholesale rates. By cutting down on
fresh meat and pinching on bacon, I managed the
company’s accounts so that we could have hot
griddle-cakes and maple syrup every day. That’s
the way I held my job. If I ever become famous
it will be for having introduced Pie in the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every morning I drove around Manila, visiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the markets with a man to help me, exchanging
sacks of flour for fresh baker’s bread and cakes,
getting chickens, and so on, besides making friends
right and left. About two nights every week I was
dancing or flirting with the half-breed women;
Mestizas they called them. That’s how I got into
trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her name was Senorita Maria del Pilar Assompcion
Aguilar, and nothing that ever I saw could
touch her for looks. She was the kind of woman
that makes you forget everything else that ever happened
before. She and her brother owned about
the whole of a province in the middle of the island
of Luzon. When she came into the room it was
all over with me. There was more of the Spanish
than the Filipino in her, enough to give her the style
and air of a lady, but she got her beauty from
the tropics. Her hair was like one of those hot
black nights they have down there—silky and soft,
drifting around her face—but it was her eyes that
made you lose sleep. They were blue-black, not
melting, but wide-awake and piercing. They were
just a bit crossed, hardly a hairbreadth out, but
that little cast seemed to make her even prettier
than if they were straight. A Kansas sergeant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>told me that the family was in from their country
place, and that the Secret Service people were
watching her. She and her brother were suspected
of knowing a good deal about Aguinaldo’s
plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>You remember that after the battle of Manila
the American troops lay in town for months, just
drilling and waiting to see what the insurgents were
going to do. There were all sorts of rumours afloat,
and nobody knew which way the cat would jump.
The Filipinos were camped in a semi-circle outside
the city and growing uglier every day. Our sentries
were watching them close enough to see every
nigger that stuck his finger to his nose at us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw more and more of Maria, danced with
her, or went to her house every night I could get
off. It wasn’t long before I saw that I had her
going. Her brother looked as if he’d like to bolo
me in the back, and never left us alone for a moment.
I didn’t care. I was too far gone myself to
be afraid of him. I’ve seen one or two women in
my time, but she could put it over them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Love goes pretty fast in hot countries. One night
I happened to find her alone. Her brother was away
on some Katipunan conspiracy business, most likely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>or perhaps dodging our spies. She was dressed
like a queen, all ready for me. I had no more
than come in when she threw herself into my arms
and lay there crying. I had gone too far, and I
was in for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I let her stay there a little while, kissing her and
trying to get her quiet, and then I looked away,
and told her what I should have told her long before—that
I had a wife and couldn’t marry. She
took it pretty hard at first.</p>

<p class='c000'>After she had cried she laughed, and there was
a load off my mind. I said to myself that women
must be different down here, and thought I was
lucky to get out of it so easy. I thought perhaps
she hadn’t been so badly hurt, after all. She
said we’d forget it, and be friends, just the same.
I was a fool and believed her. She asked me to
come back to-morrow, and I said I would.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day I met Señor Aguilar, her brother,
and he seemed to be as friendly as if we were
bunkies. He insisted upon my having a drink with
him. He seemed to be glad to know that Maria
and I weren’t so much lovers as he had thought. We
sat most of the afternoon drinking cognac, and I got
more and more pleased at having squared myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>with them both. Then some one must have hit me
over the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I came to, my head was bursting. My
hands were bound and I was covered with a sheet
of canvas, being jolted in a little bobbing cart. I
yelled for help, and my only answer was the barrel
of a Mauser rifle stuck in my face. Then I went
off into a stupor, and for the rest of that trip I only
remember heat, thirst, hunger, stiff joints and a
murderous headache. The journey seemed to go
on for years and years, but I didn’t have energy
enough even to wonder what had happened or
where I was going.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally I found myself stretched upon a cot in a
white-walled room, looking through a great arched
window into a green <em>patio</em> waving with palms. Señor
Aguilar was standing beside me, smiling wickedly.
Bromo-seltzer wouldn’t have cleared my head the
way the sight of him did.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Señor Roberts,” he said, as soon as he saw
that I was fully conscious, “possibly you may have
suspected that I have not always been charmed at
the attentions you have paid Señorita Maria. However,
you will be glad to learn that I have at last
decided to accept you as my brother-in-law. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>given directions that the marriage ceremony shall take
place to-morrow evening. I shall be honoured by the
alliance, I am sure, for within a week you will be the
only Americano alive on the Island of Luzon. I have
just come from a conference with General Aguinaldo,
and the council of war has set upon February
4th as the date when we shall have the pleasure
of capturing Manila and exterminating your army.
You are at Carrino, a hundred miles from the city,
helpless and unarmed. I think you will see the
advisability of accepting gracefully the privilege of
becoming a member of our distinguished family.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is barely possible,” he went on, “that you
may feel like declining to become the husband of
Señorita Maria. Americanos are not renowned
for their courtesy. So I give you a day to think it
over. We Aguilars do not often force ourselves
upon strangers, but under the circumstances I consent
to forget our family pride. You may give me
your answer to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew what he meant. This was a sample of
Spanish revenge with a Filipino barb to it. If I
stayed, I was a branded deserter. I knew that,
and Aguilar knew it too. And he was sure
enough that I’d never marry his sister under those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>circumstances, or he’d never have made the offer.
The only possible way out of it—although that
seemed hopeless—was to escape, carry the news
to General Otis, and save the army. It would
mean a pardon, and maybe shoulder-straps for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could I get away? That was the question. I
had no time to lose. To travel a hundred miles
through an unknown hostile country in a week,
without arms, food or money, was no child’s play.
But I watched my chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>About sundown a Tagalo woman, homely as a
hedge-fence, came in with my dinner. She hung
round as though she were willing to talk, and I set
to work to see how I could use her. I’d had some
experience with women, and had found them
mostly alike, black and white, and I used every trick
I knew on her. Of all the cyclone love-making I
ever did, that got over the ground the quickest.
I worked so hard I almost meant it, and she rose
to the hook.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night she got the guard off, filled him up
with <em>bino</em>, and showed me the way out of the plantation
through the banana grove. Outside, she had a
little scrub pony waiting. She pointed to it, and
gave me a general idea of the direction, then put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>her arms on my shoulders and held up her great
thick lips to be kissed. That was about the hardest
work I had on the whole trip. Then I jumped into
the saddle and pelted down the road like Sheridan
thirty miles away. I thought I was a hero, all
right, and I saw my picture in the papers with
shoulder-straps and the girls kissing me, like Hobson.
It was a grand-stand play to save the army.
As near as I could calculate, that was the night of
January 31st, and I had six days to get to Manila.
It looked easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I kept as nearly south as I could guess, and
rode that pony almost to death. At daylight I hid
and hobbled him and crawled into the brush to
sleep. When I woke up the nag was lying in a
puddle of blood, hamstrung. That was the first
blow.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not a soul in sight, but I imagined
there was a boloman behind every tree. I listened,
and every waving bush scared me worse.
I was actually afraid of the light. If this were the
beginning of the trip, what would the end be?
But I had to go on, and do my best.</p>

<p class='c000'>I got under cover and crawled like a snake till
I came to a patch of banana trees, where I stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>long enough to eat and to fill my pockets. For two
days I kept it up, making about thirty miles south,
I suppose, dodging villages, skirting the roads and
sleeping most of the daytime. It was hot and
dusty; food was scarce and water scarcer.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I fought my way through the tropical night,
tortured by mosquitos, insects, and ants. Luckily
it was near the full of the moon, and I was able to
drag myself along all night. The way gradually
became more moist and swampy. I toiled through
slippery mud, and had often to make detours to avoid
sinking in great morasses. Then, just at dawn of
the third morning I came upon the banks of the
Pasig. Now I had four days more in which to
save the army, and a quiet river to drift down at
night, hiding by daylight, if I could only find something
to float on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards noon, as I lay in the bushes, I saw an
empty boat bobbing down stream. I swam out to
it, hauled it ashore, and hid it in the bushes. That
night I began to paddle down the river, calling myself
“Lieutenant” Roberts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twice, before morning, I thought I heard the sound
of oars or paddles behind me, and got inshore to
listen, but nothing appeared. At dawn I drew in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to the bank, hid the boat, and crawled to a safe
place and slept like a horse. After I had foraged
for bananas and got back to the river, the boat was
gone! I began to lose hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was certain that I had tied the boat securely,
so I knew now that someone was on my trail. I
had not only to make my way on foot through
the wilderness, but I was to be dogged at every
step. What with the heat, starvation, and growing
fear, I was pretty nearly out of my head, but
the knowledge that upon me alone depended the
safety of the army kept me on, straining every
nerve. If it hadn’t been for that, I would have
given it up right there.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I had followed the bank of the river for
some distance, some logs came drifting down the
current. I took the chances of being seen, and
swam out and captured two of them. Tied together
with long, tough creepers, they made a
passable raft, and all that night I floated down
stream, paddling as well as I could with my hands.
I passed a lot of houses and villages on the banks,
and so I knew that I was approaching the city.
Sometimes I heard the sound of drums and
bugles, for the insurgents were all over the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>raising recruits. I must have been wandering in
my mind by that time, for I wasn’t a bit scared
any more—only watching for wild bananas and
bread-fruit, and wondering how long I’d last. I
succeeded in killing some of the many tame ducks
I saw, and ate them raw, not daring to build a
fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next night the river broadened out into a good-sized
lake. By the look of it, I took it to be Laguna
de Bay, about twenty-five miles from Manila.
I had only that night and the next day to reach
our troops. If the first shot were fired before I
got to the outposts, I might just as well drop into
the Pasig and go to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the sun rose I slid into the water and
struck out for the shore, intending to take my
chances along the bank by daylight. This was
the morning of the 4th of February. Somehow,
some way, I had to get through the circle of the
Filipino lines drawn about the city. I hoped that
I was too close to the town for them to dare to interfere
with an American soldier in the daytime.
So I climbed up a slippery bank and broke into
the brush, about as tired and discouraged as a
man could be and still live.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Then—all of a sudden—I was nailed from behind!
The game was up. Somebody gripped me
by the throat. I was so weak, there was no fight
left in me. In half a minute I was bound by a
dozen niggers, who came jumping out of the bushes
and fell on top of me from all sides at once. I
didn’t much care what they were going to do with
me: I had quit. Five days of fear and suspense
and suffering had taken every bit of nerve out of
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as I was tied up they began to rush
me along the road, kicking me up every time I
faltered, and jabbing me with bolos when I
fell. I don’t know why I didn’t die right then.
I don’t know why my hair isn’t white.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last we came to a little nipa hut, guarded
by Filipino soldiers in dirty white uniforms and
bare feet. I was thrown inside, unbound, and
given a gourd of rice. I ate it, hoping it was poisoned.
From all I saw, I was sure the tip about
the outbreak was straight, for the place was bustling
with soldiers coming and going, and I noticed
they all had ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about four o’clock I was bound again and
gagged. I thought it was the end, sure, this time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and I was ready to die game. But it was only a
new kind of torture. They prodded me with their
bayonets, marching me to a place where I could
look through the bushes right across a little river.
There, on the other side, was one of our sentries
pacing up and down, and way off I saw the Stars
and Stripes floating in the sun. I could hear a
band playing “There’ll be a hot time,” too. If I
could have yelled across just once and given our
boys warning, I wouldn’t have minded anything
they did to me. But I was gagged. I believe I
cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they took me back to the hut, and night
came on. Every minute that passed made the torture
worse and worse. I didn’t care for myself
any more; I was only thinking about the boys
across the river, all unconscious of what was going
to happen. I knew so well how careless they had
got to be, and what fun they made of the idea that
the niggers could possibly have the nerve to attack
us. They would all be fooling around the streets
of Manila, probably half of them at the theatre or
dancing or in the cafés, leaving only the guard to
take the first rush. It didn’t seem possible that we
could be saved. Our entrenchments would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>carried at the first charge, I was sure. The Tagalos
in town would rise, and it would mean a
wholesale massacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course you know now all about the battle,
for the night of February 4, 1899, is school-book
history by this time. I doubt if there was any
actual date set by Aguinaldo for rushing Manila,
though he had considerable trouble keeping his
cocky little niggers in order. If there was a time
set, it wasn’t that night, anyway. The Filipinos
were getting more insulting every day, and I suppose
it was only a question of a week or so at latest.
But I didn’t know it then. Everybody has
heard by this time how the row opened, with a
Nebraska private shooting at four Tagalos who
tried to pass Block House No. 6. But all I knew
was what Aguilar had told me, and from what I
saw, it looked nasty enough to be true. I could
see that the niggers were prepared to go into
action at a minute’s notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I waited and waited in the hut, dying by
inches. I hoped I had been fooled, and feared
that I wasn’t. I imagined by what I had seen that
I was at San Felipe, on the bank of the San Juan
River, where it joins the Pasig. If so, the Nebraska
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>boys ought to be nearest me. My regiment
was with Ovenshine, to the south of the city,
camped near Malate.</p>

<p class='c000'>I felt about the way you feel when a tempest is
coming up, and I was just waiting for the first clap
of thunder. Along about half-past eight, I should
say, I heard a single shot ring out, and right off, as
if it had been a signal, the Mausers began to crack
over by the river. The fire increased steadily till
they were shooting all over to the north in the
Tondo District. Company after company of Filipinos
ran past the hut, the officers yelling like mad.
Still, there was nothing but Mausers going, popping
like fire-crackers, and it seemed hours before
the fire was returned. I was sure they had carried
the town. At last I heard a volley of Springfields—I
knew them by the heavy boom, and I
knew then that the Nebraska boys had formed and
had gone into action. I had been with the regulars
long enough to look down on the volunteers;
but when I heard that firing, I just stood up and
yelled! It didn’t die down, but kept up steadily,
and I was sure the boys were holding the Filipinos
back, when the Utah light artillery got into action.
Then, just like a thunderstorm, the noise slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>swept round to the south, and the Springfields took
up the chorus down through Anderson’s Division;
first the California boys and the Idahos of the 1st
Brigade, till about three in the morning the regulars
were engaged. Of course I had to guess it
out from what I knew of the way our troops were
camped, but I imagined I could tell the minute my
regiment began to fight. The Astor Mountain
Battery and the 6th Artillery began to answer the
Filipino’s Krupp guns, and then till daybreak the
battle was going on all round the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>I waited for the Springfield fire to weaken,
dreading that we would be driven in, but when it
kept up as if it never would stop, I was sure that
we had whipped them. The Filipinos began to
retreat past the hut in disorder, the officers as
badly scared as the privates. I was watching
them, laughing, when four niggers broke into the
hut, tied my arms, packed me on a mule, and
rushed me off.</p>

<p class='c000'>For four or five days I was carried back and
forth behind the Filipino army, dodging out of
every skirmish, as the Americans pushed Aguinaldo
back all along the circle. One night we spent in
Mariquina, and left early in the morning, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>white flags were flying to lure our troops into the
town. Then we travelled southwest towards Pasai.
I wondered what they were keeping me for,
and why they didn’t either kill me or let me go.
Then I remembered what I’d heard of Spanish
prisons, and I stopped wondering and began to
pray.</p>

<p class='c000'>We ended, finally, in a church the insurgents
were trying to hold while our boys were getting
ready to charge. I was driven up into a bell-tower
half battered to pieces from our shells and
filled with smoke. A squad of natives were firing
from the windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>There in a corner was Señor Aguilar, in the
uniform of a Filipino colonel, and I knew that my
case was to be settled at last. He looked black.
I didn’t have long to wait this time. The niggers
threw me down, and put a Filipino uniform blouse
on me, taking it from a dead soldier on the floor.
I didn’t try to resist. What was the use?</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Aguilar said to me: “I hope you have
enjoyed your journey, Señor Roberts. My men
took care to make it as interesting as possible. A
man who has the courage to refuse the hand of an
Aguilar deserves distinguished treatment.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>got as far as that with his Spanish sarcasm, and
then his native Filipino savagery got the better of
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You d—— fool, did you think for a moment
that I’d let an American hound like you marry my
sister? Do you think I would let a man live who
had played with her? No, by heaven, nor die,
either, except like a dog. I have let you live long
enough to be hanged by your own countrymen.
You’re a deserter, and I’ve given some interesting
information to your spies. And you’ll be caught
fighting in our ranks!” Then he drew his revolver
and pointed to the dead Filipino on the floor.
“Take that gun, and go to the window, and shoot
down your brother dogs!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>I don’t know why I didn’t shoot him, instead,
right there, but I had lost my nerve. I went to
the window and fired at a bare space. And then,
if you’ll believe it, I saw my own regimental flag
coming up with Old Glory, as my own bunkies
formed for the rush. It was Colonel Knowlton’s
command that was to take the church. I don’t
know what ever became of Aguilar, for I just
stood up in the window and cheered as the boys
came on. They charged with a yell that did my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>heart good to hear, for I lost myself and my danger
watching the way they did the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I remembered soon enough. The Filipino
fire died away, and the insurgents scurried out of
the building like rats. I was pulled back with
them as they retreated, but as we crossed a dry
creek bed I stumbled and fell. Just then a detachment
of my own company came up, skirmishing,
and saw me. I threw up my hands, and a corporal
covered me. I knew him well; he used to
drive in the little donkey-cart with me in Manila
when I marketed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He dropped his rifle and said, “Good God!
It’s Roberts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to explain how I’d been knocked out and
captured, but they wouldn’t believe me. I had
been posted for a deserter, and Aguilar had fixed
me. All I could do was to ask them to shoot me
right there, as if I had been killed in the battle.
But they had cooled down some while I talked,
and they couldn’t do it in cold blood. Finally, the
corporal said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here, boys, I enlisted to fight, and not to
be a hangman. Roberts has messed with me, and
I can’t do it. Perhaps what he says is true; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>don’t know. If you want to arrest him, go ahead.
But I’ll be darned if I want it said that the old
114th had to shoot a deserter. Come on, and let
him take his chances!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned his back on me, and they followed
him. I ripped off my canvas coat and ran down
the creek and hid till night.</p>

<p class='c000'>There wasn’t a man on the whole island, nigger
or white, who wasn’t my enemy, and I didn’t expect
I’d ever escape. But there was a woman.
She wasn’t exactly the kind you’d ever suspect of
having a heart, but she saved my life. She hid
me in a shed outside of the town, and fed me and
nursed me till I was able to get away on a blockade
runner and come to San Francisco. I owe
that woman something, and if I’m ever flush again,
she’ll get it back.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it was a woman who sent me to the Philippines,
it was a woman who got my promotion, a
woman who tortured me like a fiend, and a woman
who saved me. And the queer part of it is that
the last one was what most people would call the
worst of the lot!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Admeh Drake was seeing his own phantoms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the Philippines on his cot; the man with the yellow
beard, Maidslow, <em>alias</em> Roberts, was looking
with eyes that saw beyond the walls of the Hammam,
when the Hero of Pago Bridge brought himself
back with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ve told me all except how you got here,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Plain drunk,” said Maidslow, “the first I dared
get after I left the Islands. But it isn’t safe for me
to stay in San Francisco, now Colonel Knowlton is
back here. If Maxie saw through the beard, he
will, and the place is full of Secret Service men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Admeh Drake suddenly jumped from the couch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you give me if I get that legacy for
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Done!” cried the Hero. “See here, it’s too
easy! Colonel Knowlton don’t know your real
name’s Maidslow, does he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I enlisted as Roberts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dead to rights. He’ll take Maxie’s word
when she identifies her husband to him. All right
again. Well, let me play Harry Maidslow, and go
with Maxie to the Colonel. I take my thousand,
and you take the rest and—Maxie. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“If Maxie will stand for it, I’m ready,” said the
deserter.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the rest of the night, the man who went
for a soldier and wished he hadn’t, and the man
who didn’t go and wished that he had, lay in an
upper corridor of the Hammam discussing the details
of their conspiracy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE WARDS OF FORTUNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Soothed by the drone of the Retired Car
Conductor’s narrative, and wearied out with
the continuous performance of the night’s
adventures, the Harvard Freshman fell asleep on
the wooden bench in his cell at the Tanks; and it
was not until a heavy hand was laid on his shoulder
that he awoke. A bluff policeman was standing
over him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your order for release has come, and you can
go now! You and your pardner was asleep, and
I clean forgot you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The officer had a similar word with the Conductor,
and led the two prisoners out into the corridor.
While they were waiting for their property
to be taken from the boxes in which it had been
stored, Eli Cook felt idly in his pocket and drew
out a torn scrap of red paper marked with Chinese
writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s all they left on me when I was
searched,” he said, with a feeble grin. “Want it
for a souvenir of a happy evenin’? It dropped
out of a Chinaman’s pocket yesterday up to Dupont
Street, and I picked it up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Freshman took it, in the same spirit of
mockery, and stuffed it into his own pocket to keep
company with several pawn tickets. As they went
together into the street the city bells were striking
two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gosh!” Coffin cried, with a burst of his old
fervor, “I feel like the chairman of a woman’s club
after an annual election. Where you going to feed
your visage, old man?” he added tentatively. He
was out of funds, hungry and weary. The hundred
dollars won from the Klondyker in the smoking
wager, deposited for bail, had, in fact, completely
exhausted his resources. The Conductor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>however, refused to take the hint, and manifested
a desire to get away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I got to snoop back to the Beach,” he
said. “This has been a hard day for me, and
I dunno how I’m a-goin’ to get even on my hundred
if I have to stand trial. I ain’t exactly
hungry, anyway, but perhaps I’ll stew up some
canned stuff out to the cars. Want to come along?
You’ll have to walk, though, and it’s full seven
miles through the Park.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, thanks,” said Coffin, dryly. “I’ve got a
poke-out coming to me at nine, and I guess I can
wait. I’ll walk up and down, and let the girls admire
me for a season.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, good-by, then!” said Eli Cook of Carville-by-the-Sea,
and he hurriedly made off down
Kearney Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>The youngster mused. “I shall now endeavor to
give the correct imitation of a thousand-dollar sport
in the act of starving to death. I am wondering,
in my simple Japanese way, whether that gentle
Klondyker with my prize money in tow, will ever
swim into my ken again. It’s a good deal like trying
to find a pet oyster in a mud flat, but I’ll try
my best. Angels, they say, can do no more. Selah!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>With that he walked up to Gunschke’s
cigar store and found the young man who had
assisted at the smoking orgy of the night before.
The clerk, however, knew nothing of the Klondyker’s
whereabouts, having never seen the Father
of the Katakoolanat previous to the debauch. The
Freshman was in a quandary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say, has your luck changed yet?” the salesman
asked. “Last time I heard, the curve was
still rising.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jove, I had forgotten all about that,” cried
Coffin. “Let’s see, I won my hundred at the
wager, then I won my thousand, more or less, in
the Chinese lottery, but then I was pulled, and
dropped the hundred at the Tanks. The grand
psychological query is, Do I get that thou’? If I
had a nickel to my name I’d put the delicate question
to the Oracle of the Slot and find out how I
stand on Fortune’s Golden Rolls.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’ll stake you; here you are,” the salesman
answered, tossing out a nickel. “I’d like to know
myself. If you’re still winning I’ll take you out to
the race-track and let you do my betting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Freshman pushed the coin down the slot of
the poker machine and jerked the handle. Three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>treys appeared behind the wire. “Bully!” cried
the salesman. “Here, you draw four cigars!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nay, nay, Pauline!” Coffin exclaimed in disgust.
“I wouldn’t eat another cigar to be crowned
King of the Barbary Coast! I can never endure
the smell of tobacco again without being as sea-sick
as a cat in a swing. Much obliged for your charity,
but I’ll call it square for the good omen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Irrationally cheered by the portent, James Wiswell
Coffin, 3d, wandered out aimlessly and floated
with the throng down towards the cheaper end of
Kearney Street. The cool, green, grassy square
at the Old Plaza attracted him, and he entered the
little park.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, the plot hatched by the Hero of
Pago Bridge and the deserter of the Philippines
had gone forward without a hitch. Drake and
Maidslow had met Maxie at the Biograph Theatre,
and she had consented to visit Colonel Knowlton
and represent Drake as her missing husband,
that Maidslow might be safe from being recognised
and apprehended by the Secret Service men as a
deserter. Both husband and wife were affected
at this meeting, after so many years, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>evident to the Hero that a reconciliation would be
easily arranged. Both were lonely. Maxie had
worked so hard and Maidslow had lived so adventurously
that the prospect of settling down to a
peaceful married life attracted them equally. This
was now possible if the legacy of old Max could
be collected safely from the Colonel. Their
scheme was nothing less them conspiracy; but, after
all, Maidslow, her real husband, would be the one
profited, for he would receive the money. Maxie’s
conscience was assuaged by this consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>At 10.30 that morning Maxie and Drake called
upon the Colonel at the army headquarters and
passed the ordeal successfully. The officer was
too busy to spend much time in investigation, and,
knowing Maxie as well as he did, it did not occur
to him to suspect fraud. At any rate, the check
for $15,000, which he passed over to Admeh
(made payable to Harry Maidslow) would not be
cashed without proper identification, and the bank
would relieve the Colonel of this necessity. He
congratulated them on their reunion, and dismissed
them in relief that the responsibility of his trust was
over.</p>

<p class='c000'>How Maidslow was to cash the check was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the question. It was easily solved, at a meeting of
the three principals in the plot, by the decision that
old Dietrich, the proprietor of the Biograph Theatre,
could identify the payee. He would undoubtedly
believe Maxie’s introduction of Maidslow as
her husband, as this time, at least, she would be
speaking the truth. They left Admeh Drake on the
sidewalk while they proceeded to this next step.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old Dutchman was canny, however. “How
do I know dat dis man is your huspant?” he said.
“You say so, Maxie, put I neffer seen him pefore!
See here, didn’t you say Harry Maidslow hat a
tattoo mark on his arm alretty? He hat a girl’s
name ’Dotty,’ you tole me once. Lemme see dat
mark, and I vill itentify him, sure! Den I know it’s
all right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was easily proved. Maidslow stripped up
his sleeve and exhibited the tattoo mark, and old
Dietrich was convinced. He put on his hat to accompany
them to the bank. Excusing himself for
a moment, Maidslow slipped out and spoke to Admeh
Drake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all right, Drake, we’re going right down to
cash the check. You get away before Dietrich
sees you and gets suspicious, and I’ll meet you with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the thousand dollars at Lotta’s Fountain in half an
hour!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Drake walked down Market Street. In a few
minutes he saw Maxie, Maidslow, and the old
Dutchman approaching. He kept out of sight
while they passed him, on their way to Montgomery
Street, where the bank was located. Then he
commenced his vigil at Lotta’s Fountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the very hub and centre of San Francisco,
in the heart of the shopping district, and the
strategic point for confidence men, tourists, loiterers,
and sports. The three great newspaper buildings
form here a towering group against the sky, and
the Palace Hotel, a massive block honeycombed
with windows, is within a stone’s throw. About
him eddied the principal currents of the town,
carrying their heterogeneous collection of humanity.
The fountain is an island in the triangular
opening formed by the union of Geary, Kearney,
and Market streets, and each of these important
thoroughfares contributed to the liveliness of the
place. Groups of brightly gowned women were
awaiting the cable cars to take them to the Oakland
Ferry, cheap actors promenaded up the Rialto of
Market Street, the Geary Street cars swung on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>turn-table, impeding the traffic, and along the sidewalk
on Kearney Street the flower-venders made
a vivid splotch of color. The whole place was
alive and bustling, and time went fast with the
watcher at the gilded fountain where no one drank.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Admeh Drake looked up to the clock
tower above his head, he was surprised to see that
it was already a quarter to twelve. He had
waited nearly an hour. He began to be impatient,
nervous, suspicious. Maidslow should have
returned with Maxie long before this. Something
must have happened, or else—he grew frightened
at the thought—they had given him the slip, and
would avoid paying him the thousand dollars as his
share of the plot. He waited now with less hope.
Surely, if they were coming at all, they would have
returned before this. He lost interest in the passers-by,
and watched only for the two who were
to bring him his reward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clock struck noon, and the throng was
swelled by clerks and business men released for
their lunch hour. One o’clock, and the tide
poured back again. Two, and he grew weary
with standing, and sat upon the pedestal of the
Fountain. Three, and he gave up all hope. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>excitement which had kept him up all night relaxed.
He was faint and limp from lack of food
and sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he, too, joined the human current and drifted
along Kearney Street with no set plan of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned into the Old Plaza, at Portsmouth
Square, his eyes caught by a sparkle of light from
the gilded sails of the little bronze ship on the
Stevenson Memorial. He walked nearer to see
what it was, and as he approached he perceived a
young man in a red sweater reading the inscription
on the marble shaft. It was the Harvard Freshman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>To be honest, to be kind</em>,” Coffin was reading,
“<em>to earn a little and to spend a little less, to make
upon the whole a family happier for his presence</em>”—and
then he turned away with a bitter protest in
his throat, to see the Hero of Pago Bridge looking
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pretty, ain’t it!” said Admeh Drake, and he,
too, looked at the immortal quotation from the
“Christmas sermon.” Had it been written for
him alone, it could not have stung him more
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“—<em>To renounce, when that shall be necessary, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>not be embittered, to keep a few friends, but these without
capitulation—above all, on the same grim condition,
to keep friends with himself—here is a task for
all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to Coffin with despair in his eye, all
that was best in him writhing at these graven
words. “Say, what the hell did they stick that
up here for, right where every man that has failed
can read it and eat out his heart?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffin slapped him on the back in sympathy, for
even the irrepressible Freshman seemed for the
moment to be touched by the admonitory legend.
But he was not one to be serious for long, and after
that one swift glance into his soul, his customary
spirit asserted itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here,” he said, “this is the way I look at
it. You can’t have good luck with your conscience
all the time, any more’n you can with your
purse. Moral: cultivate your forgettery! We
meet under the shadow of the good ship <em>Bonaventure</em>,
aforesaid ship being full of buccaneers and
sailing over a Sublime Moral Precept, by R. L. S.
I doubt if he would claim he was always such an
angel himself if anybody should drive up in a
chariot and ask him. Lastly, my brethren, why be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>phazed at a dozen lines of type? Discard your
doubts and draw to the glorious flush of hope.
Amen. Let’s have a drink.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They pledged each other somewhat forlornly in
Spring Valley water, and then Coffin remarked,
“By the way, what did you do with the dime Coffee
John gave you? Made a fortune yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I made a thousand dollars, but I’ve got it to
get. I’ve roped her, but I can’t throw her yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thou’?” Coffin exclaimed, “the devil you
have! Jupiter, but that’s queer! Why, that’s
my fix, precisely. I got it on the hook all right, but
I couldn’t haul it into the boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Exchanging confidences over the night’s adventures,
the two wandered up to the top of the sloping
Plaza, where the back of the Woey Sen Low
restaurant arose, three stories high, an iron balcony
projecting from each tier of windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s come up to the chink’s Delmonico,” suggested
the Freshman. “You can get a great view
of the city from up there, and you don’t have to
spend money if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went round to the front entrance, ascended
the stairs, and filed past empty tables, gaining the
balcony. As they stood gazing over San Francisco
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>they heard steps approaching from behind,
and two persons came into the nearest room.
Coffin, who was standing with Drake, out of sight
of the new arrivals, peeped round the corner of a
porcelain lantern.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a woman,” he whispered. “And a peach-erlooloo
of the first degree, too, by Jove! Nigger
or Kanacker blood, though. Let’s go through and
have a look at her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Drake assented. They entered the open doorway
and passed carelessly through the room. A
man at the table looked up and nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whittaker!” said the Freshman, when they
were out of sight, “the medium, as I exist! I wonder
how he ever got into a friendly mix-up with
that chocolate-colored fairy. There was no heroine
with raven locks in mine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment Vango appeared and stuck a
dirty finger in Coffin’s buttonhole. The medium’s
hair was matted and stringy, his clothes wrinkled
and spotted in a shocking disorder. “Come in
here,” he said. “I want to make you acquainted
with a lady friend,” and he escorted the adventurers
where the Quadroon sat, already clad in
widow’s weeds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Mrs. Moy Kip, let me introduce—Mr.”—here
he hesitated, and was prompted—“Mr. Coffin
and Mr. Drake. Set down, gents. This here
lady has suffered recent a sad and tragical bereavement.
I was just about to console her when you
passed by, and I hoped you might help distrack her
mind from gloomious thoughts and reflections. The
party what has just passed out, you understand, was
a Chinee, but he is now on the happy side of Jordan,
in the spirit spere, and we are some in hopes
of having the pleasure of his society to-night in astral
form, if the conditions is favorable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he nudged the Freshman under the table,
and Coffin passed the hint to Drake, neither of
them knowing exactly what was expected of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you speak Chinese, madam?” inquired the
Freshman, at a loss how to begin the conversation.
“I’ve often wondered about these signs in here. I
suppose they’re mottoes from Confucius. Perhaps
you wouldn’t mind translating some.” He pointed
to several long, narrow strips of colored paper
which hung from the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I only know a little Chinese, just about
enough to read a common business letter in the
Cantonese dialect,” said the Quadroon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Coffin recalled the scrap of paper given him by
the retired conductor in the Tanks, and he drew
it from his pocket to show to her. The sharp
black eyes of the ex-medium, sharpened by long
practice, fastened upon it, and he darted a skinny
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here you are!” he cried excitedly to the
Quadroon. “I told you I’d find it, and I done it!
Look at that, Mrs. Moy Kip, and see if it ain’t the
very same identical piece of paper you was a-searchin’
for. Oh, I felt it a-comin’ just now when this
gentleman entered into the room. I felt a wave of
self-independent spirit message, and I seen a red
aura round his head, thereby denotin’ he was a
Psychie.” Exultant as he was, however, he looked
over his shoulder fearfully as if he dreaded interruption.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Quadroon had taken another scrap of red
paper from her bosom and tremblingly placed the
torn edges of the two together. They fitted exactly.
She suddenly rose with set eyes and mouth, and
ran towards the stairs without a word.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vango followed her, leaving Drake and Coffin to
wonder at the cause of the excitement. After a
few moments the Professor returned trembling, pale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and crestfallen. He sank into a seat and covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Higgins! Mrs. Higgins!” he moaned.
“I just see her out by the stairs! She wouldn’t let
me by! Oh, God, she’s after me again! And
that nigger woman’s gone and I’ve lost her. Think
of it, after all I’ve went through, to lose her just as
I was winnin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked up haggardly and pounded his fist on
the table. “By Jimminy Christmas! That there
piece of paper was worth a thousand dollars, gents,
to me, and I’ve lost it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Drake and Coffin exchanged glances of amused
surprise, and Vango added weakly, looking at the
Freshman, “Much obliged, I’m sure, Mr. Coffin.”
He was wondering if he would be asked to divide
the prize, in case he got it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, don’t mention it, old chap,” Coffin answered,
“you’re welcome to all you can make out
of that paper with your flim-flam. That sort of
humbuggery isn’t exactly in my line. But suppose
you put us wise as to the facts in the case.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The ex-medium, still trembling with the memory
of his supernatural fears and discomfited by the escape
of the woman, pulled himself together, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>told of the remarkable series of events which had
brought him, that morning, to Hunter’s Point in a
launch containing a Quadroon woman, a dead Chinaman,
a scrap of paper, and $2,000 worth of smuggled
opium.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve been working the widow soft and easy
ever since,” he said. “Gettin’ that first piece of
paper was what I incline to denominate a masterpiece,
but this findin’ of the missin’ half right in
your pocket is nothin’ less than inspirational second-sight.
She ought to think herself lucky to have fell
in with me at no cost to herself for a sittin’ whatever.
But will she pay up? That’s the question.
Niggers is creditable, but they is also tricky. But
anyways, I bet them two Chinese highbinders is apt
to meet Moy Kip on the opposite shore to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It grew dark as they sat there, and when they
had finished their stories they went out upon the
balcony again. The light on the Ferry tower
burned like a star against the waters of the Bay.
The street lamps followed suit, and the night closed
in. The three Picaroons were in the first quiet
exhilaration that follows hunger and fatigue. Except
for the Freshman’s broken rest at the Tanks,
not one of them had slept since their meeting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>previous evening; not one of them had eaten. Their
eyes were glassy, but not yet sleepy; they were like
dead men who could still walk and speak. A dull
fever burned in their veins. Talk, then, grew faint,
and even thought flickered but dimly. There was
nothing positive to look forward to but Coffee John’s
invitation to supper at nine o’clock, so they waited
listlessly for the hour. Finally, a proposal from the
indefatigable Coffin to wander through the Chinese
quarter lured them out.</p>

<p class='c000'>They turned into Ross Alley. This narrow lane
of shops and gambling houses was swarming with
passers-by. As the three men entered the passage,
the sound of banging doors preceded them; the
outer guards of the fan-tan resorts, catching sight of
white faces and fearing detectives, were slamming
and bolting the entrances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before they had gone half the length of the alley,
Coffin noticed a Chinaman in felt hat and blue blouse
standing idly by a lamp-post, and behind him a
second man, leaning against a brick wall. The
Freshman’s alert eye awoke and took the two in at
a glance, for he noted something vaguely furtive in
their apparently careless attitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now another Chinese approached the two figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>at a rapid pace, holding one hand hidden in his
blouse. A few feet behind him a coolie followed,
looking sharply to the right and left. Coffin was
just about to call Drake’s attention to them, when,
without warning, the man by the lamp whipped out
a revolver and fired point blank at the one approaching.
The pistol barked three times in rapid succession,
then the weapon was swiftly handed to the
loafer by the wall. It was like the passing of the
ball to the quarter-back in a football game, for, on
the instant, these two and another broke through
the crowd and ran in different directions. As they
started, the bodyguard of the wounded man drew
his own pistol and sent a stream of bullets after the
fugitives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fusillade scattered the crowd in the alley.
The Chinese dodged this way and that, escaping
into doors and down cross lanes to avoid the
officers who would soon appear to question them.
The Freshman pulled his companions hurriedly into
a little shop, and, whirling them back to the door,
drew their surprised attention to a case of jade ornaments.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lay low,” he exclaimed, “the police will be
here in a moment, and we don’t want to be run in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and held for witnesses. We couldn’t identify the
chink, anyway. I say let ’em have it out their own
way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked out and saw a plain-clothes detective
running down the alley to where the dead man lay.
From the other end of the passage two officers in
uniform came up, sweeping a dozen Chinese in
front of them. One policeman lined the fugitives
in front of him, while the other examined them for
weapons. As none were found, the crowd was
rapidly dispersed. The detective looked in at the
shop door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you see the shooting?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We got to the door here just in time to see
three men running, but I didn’t catch their faces,”
said Coffin coolly. “What’s the row?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, another Tong war,” said the detective.
“Moy Kip was shot last night, and this one is the
first one to pay up the score. Of course we can’t
do nothing without no witnesses except this monkey!”
and he went about his business.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Professor Vango, as they passed
from the scene, “that’s the finishin’ conclusion to my
picnic. I hope yourn won’t end so tragic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” the Freshman replied, “you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>may find your dusky beauty yet. Then Drake has
to catch his soubrette, and I would fain discover the
gentle Klondyker. I consider it about horse and
horse. Funny! Here each of us has made a thousand
dollars, and not one is any better off than he
was last night, plum broke! That’s what we used
to call a paradox at Harvard, in ’English 13.’
And I’m carnivorously hungry to boot. I haven’t
bitten anything except a cigar since the feed last
night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor me, neither,” asserted the Professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here too!” said Admeh Drake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it would seem to be up to Coffee John
again. He seems to be the god in this machine.
Come on, and we’ll give an imitation of a three-stamp
mill crushing ore!” So saying, still jubilant,
still heartening them with frivolous prattle, the Harvard
Freshman piloted his comrades down Clay
Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they passed the old Plaza, Drake looked over
his shoulder once or twice and said, “I reckon
we’re being followed, pardners. There’s a chink
been on our trail ever since we turned out of the
lane, up yonder. I hope they ain’t got it in for us
because we saw the scrap!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The soft-footed coolie was half a block behind
them, when, without a word of explanation, Coffin
suddenly bolted and ran up Kearney Street. Vango
gave a gasp and clutched the cowboy’s arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” he whimpered. “Where’s
Coffin went? Is he scared?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can search me!” Drake said, philosophically.
“I give it up, unless he’s running to get an
appetite for dinner. Don’t you fret, I’ll stand by
you if there’s any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking the medium’s arm, he walked down Clay
Street until they came to Coffee John’s window.
Then, looking round, they saw the Chinaman coming
up to them boldly, with a grin on his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You name Vango?” the coolie said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s right! What d’you want with him?”
the cowboy replied, for the Professor was too
frightened to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinaman felt inside his blouse, while
Drake watched for the first sight of a weapon.
Nothing more formidable was brought forth, however,
than a smallish paper-wrapped parcel. Vango
took it cautiously. It was suspiciously heavy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Moy Kip wife send,” explained the Chinaman,
and retreated up the street.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>The medium, in an agony of excitement, opened
the parcel by the light of the window. It contained
fifty golden double eagles. His little beady
black eyes sparkling, he jubilantly entered the restaurant
with Drake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Close on their heels came James Wiswell Coffin,
3d, waving a bunch of greenbacks above his head.
“I got him! Oh, I got the green-eyed Klondyker
all right!” he cried. “He had cashed my lottery
ticket, and he handed me over ten hundred pea-green
dollars! Oh, frabjous day, we dine, we
dine to-night!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coffee John, who had been conversing with
some unseen patron in a tiny, curtained-off room in
the rear of the shop, now came forward and greeted
the Picaroons.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My word,” he remarked, “yer do look bloomin’
’appy, reg’lar grinnin’ like a Chinee at a Mission
Sabbath School! All but Dryke,” he added,
noticing his favorite’s gloomy looks, in sharp contrast
to the delight of the others. “Wot’s wrong?
Ain’t your aig ’atched, too? Well, per’aps it will,
yet. They’s a lydy a-wytin’ darn in thet there room
for you. Been there a ’arf hour an’ is nar nacherly
a bit impytient. Looks like a narce gal, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>if she didn’t put so much flar on her fyce. She
may ’ave good news for yer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Drake started before Coffee John finished, and,
entering the little compartment, found Maxie Morrow
awaiting him. He held out his hand in
pleased surprise. She offered him a thick envelope
in return.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’m in an awful hurry,” she began, “and
I haven’t a minute to spare. I’m afraid you thought
we weren’t going to keep our word, but really, Mr.
Drake, we couldn’t help it! I was so sorry to
keep you waiting so long, but, just as we left the
Bank, I saw Colonel Knowlton come in. I was so
afraid he’d suspect something, seeing me there with
Harry, instead of with you, and Harry was so
afraid the Colonel would put the Secret Service
men on his track, that we jumped on a car and
went right to my house on Bush Street, and Harry
has been afraid to show himself outdoors since.
We’re going to try to get away to-morrow to
Southern California, but I was just bound that you
should have your thousand dollars, so I brought it
down here. Lucky you told Harry you were coming
to Coffee John’s, wasn’t it? Now, good-by,
and good luck to you!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>With that she rustled out of the restaurant, and
Drake joined the group at the counter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nort by no means!” Coffee John was saying.
“Tortoni’s be blowed! If Coffee John’s peach pie
an’ corfee ain’t good enough fer yer to-night, yer
can go and eat withart me. Fust thing, I want to
hear the tyles told. Afore I begin to ’elp yer eat
your money, I want to know ’ow it’s come by!
After thet, I don’t sye as I won’t accep’ a invitytion
to dine proper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The proprietor was insistent, and though a thousand
dollars burned in each pocket, the Picaroons,
so gloriously come into port, sat down to a more
modest repast than had been set in that room the
night before. Between mouthfuls, one after the
other told to his benefactor the story of his lucky
dime—the Freshman with a tropic wealth of flowery
trope and imagery, the ex-Medium with unction
and self-satisfied glibness, the Hero of Pago Bridge
with his customary simplicity. Not one of them
expected the flagon of morality that was to be
broached by their host, forbye.</p>

<p class='c000'>For, as the tales developed, Coffee John’s face
grew set in sterner disapproval. Coffin’s story
moulded disdain upon the Cockney’s lip—the recital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of Professor Vango altered this expression to scorn—but
at the confession of Admeh Drake the proprietor’s
face froze in absolute contempt, and he
arose in a towering wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See ’ere, gents,” he began, folding his red bare
arms, “though w’y I should call yer thet, w’ich yer
by no means ain’t, I don’t know—nar I see wot
good it is to plyce a mistaken charity in kindness!
I’ve went an’ throwed awye me thirty cents on yer,
blow me if I ain’t! I said yer was ’ard cyses, an’
yer <em>be</em> ’ard cyses, an’ so yer’ll nacherly continue
till yer all bloomin’ well jugged for it!</p>

<p class='c000'>“You, Coffin,” he pointed with severity, “you
’ave conspired against the laws of this ’ere Styte
w’ich forbids a gyme o’ charnce, besides ’avin’
patronized a Chinee lottery, w’ich same is also illegal.
You, Vango, ’ave comparnded a felony, by
bein’ a receiver o’ stolen goods subjick to dooty in
Federal customs. And you, Dryke, who, bite me
if I didn’t ’ave a soft spot in me ’art for, yer’ve
gone an’ went an’ obtayned money under false pretences,
an’ ’arbored an’ abetted a desarter from the
harmy o’ your country, for if you believe that there
cock-an’-a-bull story, I don’t!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised his arms threateningly, like an outraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Jove. “Git art from under me roof, all o’
yer! Yer no better than lags in the Pen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The three Picaroons passed through the door
and faded into the darkness. The Cockney watched
them separate, and then reëntering his shop, turned
out the lamp and locked the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feed no more bums!” said Coffee John.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
